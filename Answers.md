1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic markup/HTML introduces meaning to the webpage rather than just presentation. Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of the tags and of the webpage and allow search engines to better optimize the page based on the contents.  

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, from one side of the container to the other. A block has some whitespace above and below it and does not respect other elements. It takes up the entire width of the container unless otherwise ordered. Examples include a default header or paragraph element. 

display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. It respects other elements. Images are display: inline by default, for example so that text can wrap around them. 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, Padding, Border, Margin. 

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

You are using the cross-axis (the vertical axis by default). 

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m"message goes here"
