1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

<!-- Semantic HTML gives meaning to elements that otherwise don't specifically address a portion of content.  For example: divs can encompass any section of content and are non-semantic, but headers, footers, and navs are all specific content elements.  They can be used in many ways, but they are SEMANTIC in nature. -->

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

<!-- Display: Block means that the element doesn't have respect for HTML elements beside it and takes up the full width avaliable. On the other hand, Display: Inline elements only take up as much width as they need and do not force new lines. -->

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
<!-- content, padding, margins, and borders  -->

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

<!-- You are using the cross axis when using the property align-items: center. (It's the justify content version for the cross axis.) -->

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
<!-- git commit -m"comment here" -->
