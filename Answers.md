1. Semantic HTML provides the meaning of an html page. This meaning provided with tags that encapsulate the context of what is in the html page.
For example... if I want the text to be desplayed like a heading, I would use <h1>heading</h1>... or if I want the text to be in the form of a paragraph, I would use <p>paragraph</p>.

2. ```display: block;``` Forms a block like structure around the content. It takes control of the entire row of where that content is, and pushes everything outside of it down to the next line.
```display: inline;``` Only takes as much space as the content needs. This allows other content to be displayed on the same line.

3. top right bottom left, in that order, when you want to assign pixel sizes. You can also asign pixel sizes in the form of (top/bottom) (right/left).

4. You are using the cross axis.

5. git commit -m "message"
