1. Semantic HTML is a way to make the anchors and tags of your website more "descriptive" so it's meta-data can be more easily found and comprehended. Instead of just <div> everywhere, semantic tags like <header> <section> <article> <footer> <figure> more accurately describe the "meaning" of your content, not just what goes where. 

2. The main difference is, an element with {display: block} takes up the entire width of the browser - or as much space as possible; and {display: inline} only takes up the space of the content (i.e., text or image) contained in that element.
