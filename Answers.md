1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

	Semantic HTML uses tags that have meaning.  Instead of simply relying on <div>'s for everything you can use less generic tag names like <header> or <nav>.  This allows for better understanding of the intent of the page for both machines and other coders.


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

	The block property allows us to manually set the width and height of an element in those cases where specific dimensions are needed.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

	You are using the cross-axis.


5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
