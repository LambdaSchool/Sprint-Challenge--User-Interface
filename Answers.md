1. specific tags in HTML used to reinforce the meaning of the info on the page(s).
2. display: block will ALWAYS take up that whole section of the page horizontally even in that content doesnt display the whole width, while display: inline ALWAYS won't.
3. Margin, Border, Padding, Content.
4. Assuming our main axis is still defaulted at a left-to-right row, align-items: center would adjust the content to the center along the CROSS AXIS so vertically.
5. git commit -m 'any message'
