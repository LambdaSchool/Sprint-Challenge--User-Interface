1. Semantic HTML is using tags with meaning. By looking at the tag you should be able to have an idea of what it is or where it belongs. Where as non semantic tags lack description. Using semantic tags also help computers recognize meaning. It helps with search engines and any other algorithims that may try to look for meaning on a webpage.

3. Content - Size of the actually content; Padding - distance between content and border; Border - Size of border around padding and content; Margin - Distance between border and other objects.

4. When using align-items you use the cross axis. Which is vertical when flex-direction: row; and horizontal when flex-direction: column;
