1- As far as my understanding to the semantic HTMl is that elements that define and contain contents with in the non semantic html . For example tags that are semantic ( <header> <nav> <section> <footer> <a> ...etc) these can contain contents with in them . non semantic elemnts that says nothing about contents and it is more likley used to style and specifity in CSS ( <div> < span>). In other words semantic represents information and eaning instead of being presentational. 

2- display: inline; // it is an elemnt that is used to style HTML which it makes a box inside of a line that doesnt give hight and width but only puts the inline targeted html element . 
Display : block; // it separates the targeted content or html element and puts it in a box with hight and width . 

3- Margin, border, padding, content. 

4- git add ----> git commit -m " this is a git command" -----> git push.
