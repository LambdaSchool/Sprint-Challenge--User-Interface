 1. Semantic HTML is a way to use HTML tags to give meaning and context to the sections they wrap around. It tells the reader of the code what each part of code is and gives insight to how the developer was thinking when writing it. On top of making the code a lot more readable, it also improves search engine communication as it describes the content of the site itself. A properly semantically marked up page will more accurately pop up in searches.

 2. display:block creates a block around the element itself, display:inline displays the element inside the same block, but within the same line. display:block elements take up max horizontal space unless assigned a width. 

 3. Content, Padding, Border, Margin

 4. The cross-axis (up-down)
