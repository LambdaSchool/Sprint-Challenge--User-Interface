1. Semantic HTML is a way to provide meaning to a webpage. By using semantic HTML you are providing your pages with an underlying meaning that not only makes it easier to read and understand but is good for SEO too!

2. Display block - Can use width and height properties. They can have margins/padding, they also expand naturally and ignore the vertical-align property. Display Inline - It flows along with text, so for instance the <em> tag will be 
inline from open to close. Inline is subject to white-spacing and ignores the width and height properties. It does use vertical-align however.

3. Content, padding, border, margin.

4. You are using the cross axis.

5. git commit -m or -am for all and message.
