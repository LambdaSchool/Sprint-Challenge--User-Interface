1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a way to structure your HTML tree to be more readable by your colleagues and a search engine. There are no downsides
to using Semantic HTML so I'd say get comfortable using it :).

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display:block; will take up the whole width while display:inline; does not respect height or width properties. Inline is mainly used for text
while block is used for content "blocks".

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content --> Padding --> Border --> Margin


4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

You're adjusting items on the y axis. Align items will affect the positioning of content in a top/bottom sense.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m/-a "message"
