1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

    Semantic HTML helps to give meaning to elements in an HTML document rather than just having a bunch of divs.
        This can help developers quickly and easily organize their websites, and this can make editing other 
        people's HTML easier. Semantic elements also help search engines find the different parts of the website.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

    Display: block elements will always start on a new line and take up the full width of the page.  Examples of
        block elements are divs, lists, and heading tags.  Display: inline elements do not start on a new line
        and they only take up the required space on the page.  Examples of inline elements include anchor tags, 
        image tags, and spans.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

    The 4 areas of the box model are content, padding, border, and margin.
        Content - The content contained inside the HTML element.  THis can include text, images, etc.
        Padding - The area surrounding the content that can be increased to give the content some blank space around it.
        Border - The area after the padding that creates a border around the padding.  This can help to give a visual
            representation of the division of elements.
        Margin - The area after the border that can give the HTML element more space between it and other elements.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
