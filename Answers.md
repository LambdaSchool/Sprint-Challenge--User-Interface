1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML will be descriptive of its content. Examples of semantic tags include "header", "section", "nav", "main", and "footer". Examples of non-semantic tags include "div" and "span", which are not descriptive.
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    Generally, block-display elements take up their own entire row, and have box-model properties. Inline-display elements do not take up an entire line/row-- instead, they usually appear within blocks.
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
    Content, padding, border, and margin.
4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
    The cross-axis of the flex-direction property value.
5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
    ```git commit -m "message content"```, or just ```git commit``` (which takes you into vi/vim/emacs)
