1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
  Semantic HTML just means that you're giving meaning to your code.  For example, if you were making a navigation bar for your website, you might use <nav> instead of just <div>.  It shows the next person reading, editing, or reviewing your code what you were doing and what your intentions for that code were.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
  ```Display: block;``` takes the element's block model and stretches it's width out to fill the entire page.  Where as ```Display: inline;``` keeps your element inside the same block of code it's already in.  It does this by not having any height or width properties of it's own.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
  The 4 areas of the box model are the content, padding, border, and the margin.
  The content is what you have written in your HTML code.  The padding is the spacing immediately around the content.  The border surrounds the padding, and the margin is the space between all of that and the other elements around it on the page.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
  The property ```align-items: center;``` is using the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
  The git command to commit staged changes with a message is ```git commit -m ""```
