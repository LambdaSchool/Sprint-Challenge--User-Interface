1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

- Semantic HTML is a way to give meaning to our code so our content is better understood by the computer. This is different from presentational HTML like divs or spans, which helps with the structure of our HTML file but doesn't necessarily describe our content.
