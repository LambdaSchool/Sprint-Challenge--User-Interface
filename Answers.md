1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML are elements that provide meaning to its content. If we us a <header> element it lets us know that
that the content between them is going to be a header v.s. if we use a <span> element we know 
nothing about the content it contains. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

```display: block;``` elements will take up as much as they can and will disrupt the flow of content
to do so. For example a block element with no width will take up the entire width of the container its in.
```display: inline``` elements only take up the amount of space that its content needs. It works with the flow
of the content and will not push down the content.
