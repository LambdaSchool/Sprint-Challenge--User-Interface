1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    I would say that semantic HTML is the practice of marking up your
    html tags in away that conveys meaning. The goal is mark up your content
    in tags that are descriptive as to what those tags contain.
    
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    Block level elements will span 100% of their parent by default and
    will also wrap around to the next line should there be no space left.
    They respect all margins/padding

    Inline elements, like <span> and <p> only take up the amount of space the
    content demands and only repects left-right margins.
