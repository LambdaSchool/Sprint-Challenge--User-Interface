1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Rather than just defining the way a page will look with non-semantic HTML, we use meaningful, or semantic tags when possible. For example, when creating a navigation bar, instead of using a bunch of non-semantic <div> tags, you could use more descriptive and meaningful <nav> tags. This is not only good for you and your fellow developers but it also helps your SEO rating, making it easier for search engines to recongnize what's actually going on within your website.  

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

A block element always starts on a new line, and fills up the total width on the web page. 
Inline elements donâ€™t start on a new line, and you cannot add height to the top or bottom of an inline element.
