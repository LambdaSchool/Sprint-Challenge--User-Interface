    The computer treats them both as block level elements; and does nothing more to differentiate between them. The difference is in the specificity or semantics. Because the name section is used; it allows developers 
    to better distinguish between different areas of the HTML. Semantic HTML is used because it helps people navigate through code. It is primarility for the human element behind programming.

    Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
    Git is version control for code. It allows developers to collaborate on code without conflicting with one another. Imagine you had a massive program; 
    with thousands of lines of code and dozens of developers. Git allows all of those developers to make and keep track of changes without conflicting with each other.
    Any conflicts are easily identified and fixed using git. It also allows developers to branch away from the production or master code and test out changes; without effecting the 
    end-product until the code is tested and working properly.
