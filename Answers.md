1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML confers meaning to the organization of a website without changing what the website looks like. Although the average web user will never realize if a website is semantically build or not, there are some who will. These include those using screen readers, other developers who might need to update the site, and search engines that index sites in part based on adherence to certain semantic conventions. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Blocks are like rocks while inlines are like water. Blocks take up height and width and shove other content out of the way by monopolizing all of the available width (even if they are not actually using that width). Inlines will take up as much width and height as they need to (cannot be set manually) and don't impact the placement of other elements, effectively "flowing."

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, padding, border, margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Cross axis. 

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

```git commit -m "message"```
