1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

## Semantic HTML is a way of describing the content of an HTML page using tags that have meaning in the english langauge.  Simple div's could always be used instead, but they provide no meaning to other developers or search engines via SEO.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

## display: block will cause an element to take up the entire width of the page.  display: inline will only cause an element to take up the width of its content, so that multiple elements can be placed on the same line.  display: block is best used for headers or anything that should take up the whole page width, while inline is best for links, spans, or other content that should be inline with the rest of the surrounding content.
