1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML is how a website is built in regards to meaning rather than presentation. Whereas <b></b> & <i></i>
    and others like them are presenational (because it focuses on how text looks rather than acts), semantic HTML includes
    headers, hyperlinks, block quotes, etc. The exception is <p></p> because it is a combination of both presenational
    code and semantic HTML.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    Where ```display: block;``` has a default width of the container, and respects the top and bottom margins as well as
    width and height when specifically stated, ```display: inline;```doesn't.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
    Content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
    The y-axsis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
    ```git commit -m '<message>'```
