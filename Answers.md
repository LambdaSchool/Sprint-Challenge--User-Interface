1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Answer: ----------------------------
Semantic HTML is essentially HTML with meaning. Semanitic HTML has different, informative tags on several sections of the script that inform the user of what type of content is in the page, its importance and how it is intended to be conveyed. For example: content within <h1></h1> is intended to emphasize importance and convey the subject matter to the audience, whereas, <p></p> may be more in-depth detail about the subject. Semantic HTML is what makes a wall of jumbled information seem succinct and easy to interpret if done correctly. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Answer: ----------------------------
```display: block;``` -- When the display property is set to block it is normal that an element defined by this property will start on a new line and take up the entire width of the web page but padding can be added to shape it.

```display: inline;``` -- Inline is pretty self-explanatory and a default of all elements unless overridden. Inline won't start on a new line but rather on the same line. A few examples of an inline element include using the <span> feature to highliht something particularly important like a vocabulary word in a <bold>text book</bold>. You cannot add space to the top or bottom like with block, however. Additionally, you can find inline elements within a block element.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Answer: ----------------------------

 ____________ Margin  ____________
|   _________ Border  _________   |
|  |   ______ Padding ______   |  |
|  |  |                     |  |  |
|  |  |       Content       |  |  |
|  |  |_____________________|  |  |
|  |___________________________|  |
|_________________________________|

Margin: This properties sections out an area outside the border, isolating the box/item created.
Border: Literally a visible line that wraps around the padding and content. Typically used to creat buttons or encapsulate information.
Padding: Creates a space in a similar way that margin does, except this specially focuses on the area around the content.
Content: Where text or images normall are! Your stuff!

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
