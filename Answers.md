1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I would say that semantic HTML doesnt just define the look or presentation of a webpage but it also strengthens the meaing of the information in the webpage and any web applications on the page.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

display: block; is the default for many HTML tags like <p> or <h1> and will take the entire width of the page. display: inline; are used for some HTML tags like <img> or <a> and will only take up the width of the content of the tag. For example, a <p> tag or paragraph tag will take up the entire width of the page even if it is just a few words. 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

The 4 areas are content, padding, border and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Using align-items: center; will senter the items in the selection vertically. For example if you are using this property in a navigation bar, the link items will be centered vertically. This does not affect horizontally.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

The command is git commit -m "message to add".
