1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is writing HTML code with tags that indicate meaning to their content. It is possible to write 
a perfectly functional and nice looking website just using a bunch of div elements, however this is confusing
to search engines and fellow developers. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block is the default for css. It means that items will take up the entire width of the web page and 
no elements will be in line, next to them. An inline element can have other elements by their side, taking up
only as much width as needed.
