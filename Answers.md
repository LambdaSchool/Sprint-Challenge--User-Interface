1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML are HTML elements that describe or provide meaning to the type of content enclosed by them to not only developers but also browsers and search engines.
For example, <header>, <article>, and <footer> provide a lot more meaning than <div>.
The content found in a <header> usually includes navigation links and a company logo, whereas a <footer> contains contact and copyright information.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

Block elements begin on a new line and use all available horizontal space whether it needs it or not.
Inline elements can begin on the same line as other inline elements, and they use only the space they need as defined by their tags. Inline elements don't start a new line.
