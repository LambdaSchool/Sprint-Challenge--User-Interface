Semantic HTML is way of naming your tags descriptively. Most people use a lot of div, and span to separate their html file into parts. Semantic html utilizes more descriptive tags such as section, article, form and table. These tags give meaning to what content they contain. They will better help you and other developers on the project to find and create specific content.
The main diference between block and inline is the amount of space they consume. Block takes up an entire line on the page whereas inline only consumes the space around the content. Specific tags are one or the other. P tags and H tags are block level tags. Span and img tags are exampls of inline tags.
The four areas of box model are content, padding, border and margin.
