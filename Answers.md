1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a set of HTML elements that provide meaning to your code. This is really important for code readability. Not only is it important for code readability, but it actually improves Search Engine Optimization by a lot. You should always practice using semantic HTML. For example, if you have articles on your page, you could place each article in an <article> tag!

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
```display: block;``` makes an element take as much space as possible. Meaning it will take a whole line, and won't share it with any other elements (Except for children inside the element that has display set to block). ```display: inline;```  elements can actually be placed on the same line. Like in the name, they are `inline` elements. They will share the line with other elements that are also set to ```display: inline;```. One downside to this is that you can't set their width or height.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
