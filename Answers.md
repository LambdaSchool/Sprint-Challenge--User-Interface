1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML is the use of HTML to convey the semantics or meaning of the elements in a webpage. It serves the purpose of providing information about exactly what is contained in a webpage, rather than just presentational information.
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    The most obvious difference between a block and an inline element is that by default the block element will take the entire width of a page and the inline element can be positioned alongside other elements. You could say that a block takes up a set amount of space, whereas an inline element can be positioned inside of a block.
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
    Content, padding, border, and margin.
4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
    You are using what I like to call the secondary axis, but this is better known as the perpendicular axis. Obviously, it runs perpendicular to the principal axis (i.e. horizontal for column or vertical for row alignment)
5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
    The command is git commit -m "insert message here".
