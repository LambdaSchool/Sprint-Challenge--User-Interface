1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
	
	Semantic HTML is a type of markup that gives more meaning to tags used. The semantic HTML tags are
	more specific than a div tag and describe the content that is contained in the tags. Semantic tags
	help search engines better understand the content on a page.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

	Inline elements don't break out of the line they are in. They will accept margin and padding, but will not affect the text around them vertically. They will push other elements away horizontally only. They will not stretch horizontally past the margin/padding/content size. 

	Block elements will break out of the line. They will accept a width and height and will move other elements around them vertically and horizontally. If no width is set, a block element will
	stretch horizontally to fill empty space.
