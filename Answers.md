Answers to the Sprint challenge questions:

Question 1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML is the solution to div soup. By solution I mean that semantic HTML uses HTML tags
    or elements that have names indicative of their purpose. For example, using the paragraph tag,

    other developers come in to take a look they'll be able to better tell what is what.
