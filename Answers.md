1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
If i had to describe it i would say 'Semantic html is the use of html markup/tags to reinforce the meaning behind all of the content on your webpage.'
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
'I think the main diffrence between the two is that blcok takes up the full width and gets extra space before and after, while inline only takes what it needs and nothing more.'
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
'In order its Content, Padding, Border, Margin.'
4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
'It would be the cross axis or the x-axis.'
5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
'You would use the git add command to grab your changes, the git commit command to commit your changes, and then the git push command to pass the saved changes to github'
but the specific command would be       'git commit -m'1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
