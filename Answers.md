1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML are the tags that describe what it is that they do or are used for. For example a 
<header> tag is commonly used for the header of a website. A <title> is used to create the title of the webpage.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block uses the full width of the page and puts a break between elements so the next element will be put on a line of it's own. Display inline does not, so the element will not be put on a line of it's own and will be 'inline' with other elements.
