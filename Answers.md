1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML gives meaning to the text. This meaning can then be used by computers and humans. More practically, using semantic HTML is good for SEO, screen readers, and for code readability.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

"Display: block;" elements are rude. They take up the entire horizontal space. This is good if you want elements to be completely separate. 

"Display: inline;" elements are polite. They take up only the horizontal space that is necessary for them to exist. This means you can stack many inline elements on the same line, which you can't do at all with block elements.
