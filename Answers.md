1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    ANSWER:
    It is of great importance to use descriptive (semantic) sections. Using <header>, <article>, <nav>, and <footer>
    is far more descriptive to the browser rather than using divs. This sort of readability allows for better SEO results as well as it helps people enjoy the internet with everyone else. It is crucial to use semantic HTML in order to help people access the internet who might not have had the chance to do so with divs due to their disability.
