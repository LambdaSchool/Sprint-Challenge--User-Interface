1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say? 
Semantic HTML is used to better define the content on a web page so that the content is easier to find in a search engine like google. It allows you to set the priority of the information on the page so that when someone searches for something related to the page the right information comes up in the right order of importance, and it may push your page higher on the results than a similar page with similar information, that didn't use semantic HTML, giving your page a slight edge over the competition. 

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
Display: block will display an element as a block with some space above and below, and won't allow any HTML objects next to it unless you override the behavior with a float command. This will prevent other elements from being inside the block. display: inline places elements inside of a block in a line across the page, but overrides the height and width commands making everything fit inside the parent block. 

3. The four areas of a box model are Content, Padding, Border, Margin. 

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center? Objects will be pushed to the center of the cross axis. 

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? git commit -a (or --all, or the specific files you want to commit) -m
