1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML uses more descriptive HTML tags to help computers understand the differences between various divs. Examples of semantic HTML would be the <section> and <article> tags. Both denote specific content style layout. The <section> and <article> tags are very similar with the main difference being that <article> can be used to pull a section on a website that can be shared on another. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block elements start on a new line, and fills up the horizontal space left and right on the web page. The margins and padding on all four sides of any block element can be edited. Examples of block elements include <div> and <p> tags. Inline display allows an element to be on the same line as another element. The main difference is you can add space to the left or right of an inline display but you cannot add height to the top, padding to the bottom or margin.
