1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

"Semantic HTML" refers to the idea that your HTML markup should convey meaning about its contents. Some examples of semantic elements, or "sectioning elements", include <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

The CSS display property sets the visual behavior of an element, or renders HTML elements. ```Display: block;``` starts elements on a new line, takes up all available width, and allows for height and width adjustments (ie. <p>). ```Display: inline;``` allows elements to be nested inside other elements, nulls height and width properties, and only takes up as much space as its contents (ie. <a>).

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Margin > Border > Padding > Content

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

The cross axis.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git is valuable to a team of developers because it allows team members access to a blazing fast version control system. The system allows its users to store and track file changes live on a cloud. Team members can always look back at the changes they've implemented in the past.
