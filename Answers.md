1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic html is when you use the code to properly identify content, sections, headings, navs, etc, so that a search engine can make better use of catloging it I suppose

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```. 
So a block is like your content all the way accross the page (until you put in limiters,margins, width, etc), every element is like a block.  And an inline block is saying that you want multiple pieces/blocks to appear on the same line/space that one block was already taking up.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
You got your stuff you write, like your headers, p's, buttons, etc, and then you got your padding, border and margin surrounding it

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
What is the cross-axis, Alex?

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
git commit -m "the thing you have to do if you don't want that giant page full of text that I don't understand yet to pop up"
