1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
   
   Semantic HTML is code that doesn't necessarily add to the function of code but makes it more meaningful
   and easy to read for both other developers and for web browsers. It also helps with SEO because it makes it clear with items on the page are meaningful for readers.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

```display: inline;``` puts an element in line with text or other elements on the page. Inline elements don't respect height or width but you can use padding and margins.

```display: block;``` doesn't allow other elements to sit next to it (so it makes its own row), but respects height and width.
