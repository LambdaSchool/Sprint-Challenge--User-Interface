1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Ans: The purpose of semantic HTML is to give added meaning to the content on a page, meaning that is 
    interpreted by the browser in order to properly display content to the user, (both in or page, and in 
    search engines). We do this by using specialized HTML tags (e.g. h1-h6, section, address). Tags such as 
    these explicitly divide our content into meaningful sections, which can be interpreted by browsers, 
    where otherwise little or no meaning would be gained.


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    Ans: The block value on the display property makes the element jump down to a new line, and take up the 
    full width of that line, with no space for other elements. In contrast, the inline value permits the element 
    to stay on the same line as other inline elements. Note that elements with the value of inline will only react 
    to their horizontal margin changes, and will completely ignore their height and width values.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
