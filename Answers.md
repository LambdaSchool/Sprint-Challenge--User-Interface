1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I would describe semantic HTML as way to define sections of the web page. Instead of using a <div> for every section in a web page you can use semantic HTML to make it easier to read and understand by using <header> <section> <article> <nav etc. Websites that have helped me understand this topic are https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics and https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp .

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

`display:block` The content will be vertical and adds a line break and also takes up the width that it has available. 
`display: inline` Content is horizontal and only takes a small amount of the width.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

cross-axis

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m
