1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
> Symantic HTML is a naming convention for tags which imputes meaning to those tags, where as other naming conventions may not impute meaning. For instance, <section></section> or <header></header> are both containers but their names give clues about what those containers should or do contain: content info and header info respectively. Where as <div></div> only provides the information that it is a container.  
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
>```Display: block;``` organizes the content it applies to as an item on the page such that each item does not "play well" with eachother, a block is an entirely new element on the page with it's own set of rules. ```Display: inline;``` is far more friendly. It conforms to that which is around it by sharing a baseline. Inline elements feel like words in a sentance that line up nicely with eachother (or letters in a word) and respect boundaries. Block elements feel more like paragraphs, chapters, or even entire books.
