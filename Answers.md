1. Semantic elements are tags that make sense to the documentation based on the project such as using a nav for a navbar, article for text that is usually like a weblog or units of content, while sections are used as their name implies to section areas usually having an h1 - h6 heading along with their content.

2. Display block sets the element to the full width of the current size of the element it is contained in or the body if there is no container and they start on a new line. Inline elements stay on one line and cannot take width or height unless displayed as inline-block or block elements.

3. margin, border, padding and border

4. You are using the cross-axis as long as the flex-direction is row, otherwise when it is column the axis becomes the main axis and then justify-content controls the cross-axis.

5. git commit -m
