            <p>
                Have you ever thought to yourself, "Hey, I wish I could have a slack bot do everything for me." No? Well this is the 
                perfect product for you. Slackbot can do anything and everything, as long as you understand the markdown scripting 
                alongside the rules of static messages. Don't know it? Don't worry, that's what our Training Kit is for.

            <h2>Windows XP Training Kit</h2>
            <p>
                This is probably the most 90s thing I've ever googled in my life. Technology-wise. You can learn how to use Windows XP
                professionally. This probably isn't what you're looking for, but hey, it's educational!

            <h2>A Leaf</h2>
            <p>
             Yeah, it's just a leaf. I ran out of ideas, so we decided to take one of the things that businesses took for granted and 
             innovate it to a degree not known before. Imagine the ecological savings! Now the EPA won't bust you for all those carbon 
             emissions your oil plant has been making. Oh, there's something in here about an "income share agreement"? What's that about?

          Okay, so technically we don't even charge you. We use a fancy thing called an ISA. But don't worry, it's essentially 
          the same thing as a corporate loan. Especially if you're not a student.
