Semantic HTML: I would describe semantic html as pieces of the html language that are

meant to be descriptive of the content inside of them. While some of them have some special

effects that they can be used for, for the most part, they serve to inform developers in the future,

yourself included, about the meaning of the code they're reading.


Display Block vs. Inline-Block: These refer to properties of HTML elements expressed in CSS. 

Most HTML elements are `display: 'display: block' by default, which means that they will expand to fill

any space available on the page, regardless of whether or not the content requires it. 

The counter-part property, 'display: inline-block', is not a default setting, and therefore must be 

invoked in a CSS style rule. This property allows an element to only take up as much space as is 

necessary to display the content within the HTML element.

4 Areas of the Box model: The four parts of the box model are, from inner-most to outer-most, 

content, padding, border and margin. This allows for the manipulation of the sizing, spacing, and positioning

of content on a web-page, by changing the amount of space an element and it's content takes on it's various sides.


Align-items: Align items controls how flex items are placed relative to the cross axis, very similiarly to the way

justify-content controls how flex items are placed along the main axis.

Staging Commits with a message: The git command for this is 'git commit -m "insert message."'

This, much like semantic HTML serves the purpose of informing future developers of a piece of code,

about the purpose that the code, or in this case, a specific change in code was meant to serve.
