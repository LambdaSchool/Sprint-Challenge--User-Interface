1.Semantic HTMl is when your markup for the page has some meaning to it so it can be read by fellow developers/computer in an easy to understand way. If the markup is all divs then it will take awhile to piece together how the page is laid out. But if there is sections, header, footer, and so on, it will make it easier to see how the page is set up.
2.Block elements will break to a new line and take up the whole width of the page while inline elements will stay on the same line as the other content. Inline elements also do not let you set a height and a width for the specific element, they take the height and width from the content. Block elements can be adjusted for height and width.
