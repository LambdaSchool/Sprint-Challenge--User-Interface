1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the webpage, rather than just presentation. It provides structure to core data and components of a webpage such that style rules and guides can easily be applied to some all or all sections, making complex visual customization possible. Semantic meaning also plays an important role in providing structured data (text/keywords, urls, etc.) to search engines for SEO.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block gives the property of making the elemental's width stretch the full width of the webpage. It prevents other elements from being able to occupy the same horizontal space as the given block element. Inline allows for other objects to all occupy the same horionztal space without pushing each other down. It's similar concept to writing a paragraph in a word processer. Words/characters can occupy the same line unless a return key (shift + enter = /n) is present, which forces all subsequent text down a full line.
