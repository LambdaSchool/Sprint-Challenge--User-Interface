1. Semantic HTML:
    Semantic HTML helps describe the content that is on the page. It gives a number of elements to break up the content into easily readable sections. This also makes styling the different page areas a lot easier, since you can define CSS code to the specific regions. As an example, you can set your "nav" region to stretch all the way across the screen, while your main "content" to be a max width of 75%. While this can also be done using "div", it provides a clearer look at what's going on.

2. Display:block vs display:inline:
    The main characteristic of display:block is that it covers the entire width of the page, with nothing else next to it. Display:inline only covers the amount of space it requires, and can be used anywhere in a line, allowing you to place multiple inline blocks on the same line.

3. 4 areas of the box model:
    The four areas of the box model, from the outside in, are: "margin": the space around the outside of everything,
    "border": the box itself, which can take up space depending on the width of the line,
    "padding": space between the border and the content,
    "content": the text, images, and everything else.

4. Flexbox axis using align-items:center:
    The flexbox axis that is used for the align-items: center property is the cross-axis, which crosses the main axis. If the flex-direction is a row, the cross-axis runs up and down. If the flex-direction is column, the cross-axis will run across the page.

5. Git command to commit staged changes:
    The git command to commit staged changes and write a message is 'git commit -m <message>'. This writes the changes to the local repo.
