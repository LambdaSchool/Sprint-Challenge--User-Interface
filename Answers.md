1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic elements are elements with specific names, that denote sections (for yourself and other programmers) to help organize your code, similarly to the layout of a newspaper. They also convey a specific meaning to the browser to describe the content within. Some semantic HTML tags are <section> <header> <nav> <footer> <article> and <address>

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block display differs from Inline display, in that it takes up the entire width of where that element is situated on the page; whereas inline block will only take up the space of the content within that element, or the set height/width that you dictate.
