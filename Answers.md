1.) Adaptive web design & responsive design each have their own advantages but differ in many ways. The prime intended function is what will decide which format a coder will use. Adaptive is designed to fit into various resolutions across many devices. However, it relies on fixed screen sizes and several different layouts will have to be made to account for all devices.  A responsive design requires only one template and will adjust itself accordingly to the different screen sizes through the use of media queries.

2.) A desktop first design is a layout built for the highest resolution and details commonly seen on desktop computers. A desktop site will be content rich and then adapt to smaller sizes through adaptive or responsive design. A mobile first strategy will prioritize focusing on the core elements of a web page to better optimized for smaller screens (tablets, phones ect..

3.) Using font-size 62.5% in the HTML tag allows for easier calculations when converting font-sizes from pixels to rem by allowing us to use base of 10 calculations instead of 16.

4.) CSS is a tedious way to code and shares little in familiarity with higher level languages. Pre-processors make life easier on a coder by allowing a him/her to use more common syntax, like javaScript, to pass styling instructions into a compiler, which then converts and formats those instructions properly to be read by CSS.

5.) My favorite pre-processing concept is being able to use nesting like one does in javaScript. javaScript was the first coding
language I learned so it's always been the language I feel most comfortable with, so using a preprocessor really helps me with my
thought process and planning. The most difficult part about pre-processing at first was the initial set up and
functioning through git bash. However, after just a few days of using it, it has become a second language.
