1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a way of using universally identifiable code. This allows search engines and computers to easily identify what your page contains, and also makes it easier for any developers after you to work with your initial structure and make any changes neccessary.

2. Describe some differences between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

Displaying an item in block will cause it to take up the entire width of its parent's container while display inline will only take up as much room as the box model is set to.

Another big difference is that display box respects the width and height attributes while inline does not.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, padding, margin, border

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

This will utilize the cross-axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

Git commit -m "Message" is the command required for this.
