1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Ans 1: Semantic HTML gives meaning to the WebPages rather than just presentation.Semantic HTML makes sure that all the
       HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of the content.
       Example:Before Semantic HTML <div> was throughout the WebPage without having concrete meaning as whether this
       particular <div> is used for header,or for footer or for navigation,was not clear.
       Now with  semantic HTML we have <nav>,<header>,<footer>,<article> and many more which clearly states a
       particular element is used for what. Much easier for developers and the browser.


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Ans 2: display:block
       Takes up full width available, with a new line before and after. Elements with display: block  can have a width,
       height and margin. Example:<p>,<div>,<h1>…<h6>.

       display: inline
       Takes up only as much width as it needs for content, and does not force new lines. An element with
       display: inline  cannot have a height or width or a vertical margin ;but it can have
       horizontal margin.example-<span>,<a>,<em>.
