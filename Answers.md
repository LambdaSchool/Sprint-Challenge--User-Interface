 1.semantic HTML is an abbreviation of some HTML language ex <"p"> means a paragraph while <"h1"> means header etc.

2.an display:inline to me is almost like a solid it takes form of the element in other words its does not cause a line break "start on a new line" and won't fill the width of the page only what where the tags open<> and close </>. while an display:block works more like a liquid it tries to fill the whole width of the page, in other words the black element will start a new line and take the full width of the page some example are <"div"></"div">"

3.content, padding, border, margin

4.cross-axis

5.git commit -m "message here"
