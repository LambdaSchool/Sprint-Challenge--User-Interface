Task 2: Comprehension Questions


1.  Semantic HTML tags are tags which indicate what kind of content is
    contained in the element.  So instead of generic containers like div
    and span, semantic tags include things like nav, which would presumably contain navigation links.

2.  The CSS attribute display: inline causes the browser to use only
    enough horizontal space to contain the item, and will place other
    elements on the same line with it.  display: block on the other hand
    will use the entire width of the parent element to display the item.

3.  The 4 areas of the box model are the content, the padding, the border,
    and the margin (working from the inside out).

4.  The CSS Flexbox attribute align-items: center will position items 
    centered on the *cross axis*.

5.  The git command to commit staged changes and include a message is:

        git commit -m "your commit message here"
