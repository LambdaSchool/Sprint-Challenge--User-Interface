1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

    If I had to describe semantic HTML, I would say, semantic HTML is when you try to give meaning to your HTML file, such as using the article tag for content that has meaning together but doesn't make sense on its own, or using section tags for new sections of your site verse using a div.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Block will always take the maximum width, and inline takes what is needed for the content. You can also set the width and hight of a block.
