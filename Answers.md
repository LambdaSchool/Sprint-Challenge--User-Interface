1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Like writing or speaking english or any other language HTML can be written informally and formally. Semantic HTML refers to the formal way of writing HTML. In it every piece of content that makes up your web page has some meaning behind it. It is expressely there in order to fulfill the purpose of the web page.
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
While both display styles allow for attributes to be nested inside of them, Elements that use the block style take up as much space as they can. The block style makes the user have to modify the code in order to compliment the rest of the page, things such as width and height. The inline style on the other hand isn't as cumbersome. The style allows for code to be put inside of other code without any change to the surrounding elements.
