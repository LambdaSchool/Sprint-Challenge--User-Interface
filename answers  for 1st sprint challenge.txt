If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantics is the meaning of words in a language. In semantic HTML elements give the browser and 
developer meaning. An example of non-semantic HTML is a <div> tag, it is considered non-semantic

Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git is extremely valuable to a team of developers and especially to large teams working on huge 
projects. There are several reasons why git is so valuable. One of the biggest reasons is that
it keeps track of minor changes to a project and any developer on the team can contribute to changes.
The changes are saved every step of the way so you can always go back to previous versions. Git uses 
"snapshots" to record all changes and their method is much more efficient than other Version Control
interfaces.
