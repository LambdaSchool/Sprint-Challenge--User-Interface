1 - Semantic HTML is a way of giving your divs, or other tags more specificity in your HTML. Instead of just saying <div> or <span>
you would use <section> or <article> which are more specific and easier for both a browser and other developer to understand.
2 - Display block is different from display-inline in  display-block puts the element in a block which gives the element whitespace around it and only fills up the block that its in. Inline on the other hand doesn't have the block and fills up the width of the page with no line breaks in between.
3 -The four areas of the css box model are (from inner to outer): content, padding, border, and margin.
4 - When using align-item: center, we align the item on the cross axis.
5 - The git command to commit and write a message is git commit -m" message goes here." .
