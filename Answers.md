I would describe semantic HTML like the key words that you're calling something what it actually is in HTML.  An outrageously overused example is  that if something is a table, it should contain rows and columns of data. To use that for layout is semantically incorrect - you're saying "this is a table" when it's not. Just like a list (<ul> or <ol>) should  be used to group similar items (<li>. 

Display block is a block-level element exists only in the entire space of it's parent element (container) and inline element has free reign of the app you are creating. For example, a <span> element is used as an inline element and a <div> element as a block level element.
