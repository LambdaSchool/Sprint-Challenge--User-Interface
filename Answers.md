1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic html simply refers to any HTML tag which is descriptive. For instance, anything wrapped in a <section> would obviously be described as a section within the code structure. Anything within an <address> tag would be address information. This is not only for developers to easily comprehend the code but also for SEO purposes. When one searches Google for an address, these search engines can easily extract the data they need, like from the <address> tag, and show you the results you're looking for.
