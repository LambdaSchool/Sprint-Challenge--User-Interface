Semantic HTML means that it puts more emphasis on what the content of your code and your page say and not just how your page looks. I mean that when another developer, you, a search engine, etc., looks at your code, it is more apparant what you are trying to do and say. Instead of just saying DIV you can say heading, paragraph, header, footer, article, etc. It makes your code more meaningful to look at and easier to understand.

Block elements will fill the entire line horizontally, the next block element will naturally drop down to the next line down, and you can assign them padding and margins and they will ignores the vertical align property. Inline elements will ignore any top or bottom margins, but you can assign right or left margins and padding, they will ignore width and height settings and is subject to vertical align property.

The four areas of the box model are content, padding, border and margin.

When you use the align-items: center; you are using the cross-axis.

The command is git command -m "message"
