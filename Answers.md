1. Semantic HTML is a nice way of saying "Set the page up so it's easy to change and easy to read."
We learned a lot about how to position and tag everything correctly in the HTML file and use a 
seperate CSS files to make it look presentable instead of a mess of content

2. Inline elements are fixed, meaning with a Block element you can manually set the width / height of
said element.

3. Margin, border, padding and content are the "layers" of a block element. Margin is space around,
Border is literally the border around the element, and Padding is space from the border to the content.
Lastly there is the content at the core of the element, text, image (both maybe?!)

4. algin-items:center would be centering items using the "Cross-Axis"

5. In my terminal I use "git commit -m "MESSAGE STUFF"
