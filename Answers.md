1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a more specific and descriptive style of composing HTML elements. 
Using semantic HTML allows the browser to categorize the content on your page in a way that is more
meaningful. An example would be instead of using a div to start the portion of a site that is a blog article, you could use the semantic tag of <article>. This informs the browser that the content can stand on its own as an article and it isn't just another random section of the page.
