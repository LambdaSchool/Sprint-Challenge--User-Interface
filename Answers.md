1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

* [ ] If development is painting, semantic HTML is paint by number. Not in that semantic HTML implies simplicity or is anything less beautiful. On the contrary, it's often more pleasing to the eye. But, like a paint-by-number picture, semantic HTML is easy to follow and makes sense at a glance both before and after the paint is added.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

* [ ] Display block, by default, resists HTML elements next to it. Display inline is displayed inside the current block on the same line.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

* [ ] Content. Padding. Margin. Border.

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?

* [ ] Cross axis

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

* [ ] Git allows the workload of projects to be cohesively distributed across teams of developers, as well as track development versions/progress through the branch model.
