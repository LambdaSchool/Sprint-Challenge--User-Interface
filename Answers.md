1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is all about adding "meaning" to your HTML. Instead of elements like 'div' and 'p',
you might use 'form' or 'address'. These more description tags help better define your HTML as well as aid
with SEO ratings.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

An element which has 'display: block' natively would be a 'p' or 'div' tag. The 'a' or 'span' tags both 
make use of 'display: inline" natively. The main difference between the two is a block element can have both
height and/or width, whereas an inline element only takes up the size of the object. To add further, an inline
element will also ignore width and height adjustments.  

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
