1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
   
    a. I would say that semantic HTML is HTML that is more descriptive of it's content compared to non-semantic HTML which is typically used for the presentation. Semantic HTML tag examples include header, nav, section, footer. Semantic HTML also helps screen readers and search engines parse your code into a format that is understandable by both humans and machines. Non-semantic tags include tags like the div tag which are typically used in conjunction with CSS to provide presentation changes to the page.
    
2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

    a. <display: block;> sets an element to block level. This means the element should take up one entire horizontal row (100% width) of the parent container. p tags are a good example of a block element.
    
    b. <display: inline;> sets an element to inline. This means that the element will not wrap to the next line (break the line) and if left unchecked will take up an infinite amount of horizontal space of it's container. span tags are a good example of an inline element. 
    
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

    a. The box model's layers (from the inside out) include content, padding, border and then margin. Most modern websites use the border-box in CSS to have a more intuitive interaction with the box model.
    
    
4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
   
    a. Assuming the flex-direction is set to row or reverse-row then the align-items property refers to the cross axis. If the flex-direction is set to column then things flip around and the align-items property refers to the main axis.
    
5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
   
        git commit -m "descriptive message here"
