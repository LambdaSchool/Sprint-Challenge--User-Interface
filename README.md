<h2 align="center">Instructions</h2>

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in semantic HTML, CSS fundamentals, CSS flexbox module, and git.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

In this challenge, you build a missing header (navigation and image) on the home page, update some CSS styling on the home page, and create an additional page (About) which will link from the navigation you created.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your web page should look like the solution screen shots of the home and about pages:

<h2>Quiz</h2>

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.




<h2 align="center">Requirements</h2>
<h2><b><code>/homepage</b></code></h2>

[Review the provided design file for the home page](design-files/home.png).  Notice the navigation and header images are missing.
<ul>
 <li>Build the HTML and CSS to create the missing navigation and header.
 <li>Link the `About` navigation item to the [about.html](about.html) page

 <code>box1: teal</code>|<code>box2: gold</code><code>box3: cadetblue</code><code>box4: coral</code><code>box5: crimson</code><r>
 <code>box6: forestgreen</code><code>box7: `darkorchid` box8: `hotpink` box9: `indigo` box10: `dodgerblue`

<h2><b><code>/aboutpage</b></code></h2>

[Review the provided design file for the about page](design-files/about.png). You have been provided the HTML wrapper, footer, and page content for the about page. Create the rest of the missing HTML and CSS to match the design file.

<ul>
 <li> Copy and paste your home page navigation and header into the about page
* [ ] Update the header image with the about page image
* [ ] Link the `Home` navigation item back to the `index.html` page.
* [ ] Build the rest of the about page layout to match the design

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

<h3 align="center">Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:
<ul>
 <li>Build a page of your choosing from the navigation items.  Come up with content and images that fit the theme.  
 <li>Introduce CSS animations to your site.
 <li>Build a contact page and create a form with several inputs of your choosing
 <li> Add responsive breakpoints to your code by using media queries
</ul>
