1. Semantic HTML is the specific and accurate markup of your HTML page(s). Some examples of semantic HTML are h1/h2/etc, <p>, <strong>. Semantic HTML is important because it lets both the reader and browser know what your contents are meant to be/look like. It is also much easier to read and understand code both for yourself and anyone else viewing.
2. Display block only allows one piece of content for the entire width of the page, whereas inline allows multiple pieces of content to align horizontally.
3. The 4 areas of a box model are margin, padding, content, and border.
4. 'Align' uses the cross axis.
5. To commit in git, type: git commit -m 'message'
