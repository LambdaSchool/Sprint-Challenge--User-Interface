2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
     ```display: block;``` means that there is whitespace around it and does not allow HTML elements to be around it, unless

     time consuming to use. ```display: inline;``` allows you to display elements on the same block and on the same line.
