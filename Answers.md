1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is giving tags meaningful discriptions that the browser could understand. If you were to see the word section, you would know that it is a section containing things. If you saw the word div, you wouldn't know what it is, or what it is trying to do. The semantic HTML is maintained by the W3C (world wide web consortium) to prevent the confusion of every company establishing their own tag names.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

If you are using inline, you are only taking up the width of that particular content, so other elements will stack up to the right of that element.
