1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a way for humans to have much more readable and writable code. For example when I have a section tag, we all know that this section is separate from others. It gives each tag a meaning instead of just set up for presentation.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block: This is where a single element takes up all the width of its parent. Just like stacking blocks on top of each other.

Inline: This is when multiple elements are presented inside a single block on the website. You can have as many inline elements in a single block as will fit.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Margin, padding, border, and content

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

It uses the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

git commit -m "message in here to post"
