1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page.  It introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.  Tags like <b> and <i> are not semantic, because they define only how the text should look (bold or italic) which is presentational.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

When using display: inline, the element tries to take up as little layout space as possible.  It will accept margin and padding, but the element still sits inline. Margin and padding will only push other elements horizontally away, not vertically.
 When using display: block, the element will take up as much space as possible with its width spanning the entire width of its parent element.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, Padding, Border, and Margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m 'Some text'
