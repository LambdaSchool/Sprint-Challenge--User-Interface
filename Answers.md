1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
“Semantic” literally means “Meaning.” 
Imagine this: I have a pet. You have a pet.
But our perception of what our pet is may be different. My pet may be dog and yours may be a turtle. In our mind, we both have different meanings as to what our pet is. 
If I were to go to the pet day care and say, “I am picking up my pet,” the attendant may give me a “pet,” but it is possible she gives me a turtle, pig, or a hamster since there are different kinds of pets. This becomes a problem.

This is why Semantic HTML is created. Semantic HTML allows our browser to create common meanings to understand us and make sense of all the information that is available today by providing a universal framework to describe and link data. 

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
display: inline is a display mode to use in a sentence. If this was used by an element, the element just takes up as much width it needs and it would be contained on the same line. Hence, inline.
display:block takes up the full width that is available with a new line, creating a line break after the element.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Content, Padding, Border, Margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
Cross Axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
git commit -m "Message here"
