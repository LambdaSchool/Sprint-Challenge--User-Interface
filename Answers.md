1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is HTML that adds an actual meaning to your web page, rather than just presentation. For example, the <b> tag and <strong> tag  add the same presentation of being bolded, but only the <strong> tag tells your browser and SEOs that the contents of it should be stronger than the rest of the text that is surrounding it. Semantic HTML is also needed if a user on your site has some sort of disability. For example, if one of my users was blind, inside of the <figure> tag I would add the <figcaption> tag that allows me the ability to describe the image to the user, which will be read to them by a screen reader. Semantic markup isn't about presentation, it's about meaning.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block level elements are formatted visually as blocks, they take 100% of the parents width and are placed vertically one after another. With inline elements the content is distributed in lines and it only occupies the content's space meaning no line breaks. Inline elements also have no height or width and the only padding and margin they can except are on the left and right.
