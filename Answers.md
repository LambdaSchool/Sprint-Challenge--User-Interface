1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
> Symantic HTML is a naming convention for tags which imputes meaning to those tags, where as other naming conventions may not impute meaning. For instance, <section></section> or <header></header> are both containers but their names give clues about what those containers should or do contain: content info and header info respectively. Where as <div></div> only provides the information that it is a container.  
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
>```Display: block;``` organizes the content it applies to as an item on the page such that each item does not "play well" with eachother, block is an entirely new element on the page with its own set of rules. ```Display: inline;``` is far more friendly. It conforms to that which is around it by sharing a baseline. Inline elements feel like words in a sentance that line up nicely with eachother and respect boundaries. Block elements feel more like paragraphs, chapters, or even entire books.
