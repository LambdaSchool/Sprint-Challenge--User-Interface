1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is using meaningfully named tags that have been added to the language to give a more accurate desciption of the contents meaning to both the next developer that uses our code and screen reader accessibilty purposes. Tags such as main, header, nav, footer, etc. all hold more meaning that arbitrary div and span tags that are used for presentational (visual styling and layout) purposes and dont add value to the context. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

 inline elements take up as much space as they need while still allowing any other inline elements to occupy space next to them in the same row. block level elements on the other hand take up all available spacing in their containers row, not allowing sibling elements to occupy horizontal space next to them in their respecive row.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
