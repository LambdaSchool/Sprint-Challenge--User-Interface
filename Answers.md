1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is when you use tags based on their meaning, signficance, and purpose rather than their aesthetic or display. 
For example, a <section> can look like anything you want visually; however, in the code, the developer knows that it's an area where its contents pertain to one another and should be kept together in some way. It increases readability of code.

- Starts a new line

###Inline
- Size conforms to content

- Size not adjustable
