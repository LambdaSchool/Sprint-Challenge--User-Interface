I would explain to the next cohort that semantic HTML isn't necessarily the content of the website, but it's the framework for html. Its the code that tells HTML what the information should do or what the section should represent. The semantic HTML will make it so the browswer what information you type is supposed to mean. If something was wrapped in a <p> tag, it would a paragraph, but if something was wrapped in a H1 tag, this would tell the browser that this is the most important heading of the webpage.
The biggest difference is that display inline will only take up the space necessary on the line of code. However, block will take the entire width of the container it is in if the width is not defined. Inline elements a  user cannot specify height and width, with block elements you can. Also inline elements allow other items to be next to them, where as block elements may not. In order for this to happen it would need to be inline block.
1. The content is whatever the content is whether its an image, paragraph, or something else. 2. The padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. TThe border is the border that is the end of the element, this could be invisible or defined. The margin is the space between the element and any other element.
When you use the align-items:center, you are using the cross axis.
