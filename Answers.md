1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I would describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students as a way to use html elements for what they are rather than use them for presentation in the browser. It is the difference between using something that was built for a specific use compared to using that same thing with "poetic license". 

A good example would be using a tire on a car vs. using a tire as a flower pot in a yard.  They both serve a use both practically as well as presentationally (think white walls on a 70's caddy) but when on a car, the tires are serving their intended use. 

Semantic HTML is important for communication. It gives readers the ability to deciminate information by importance through the HTML used, where as not using them makes it difficult for search engines, browsers, etc to determine the importance or important pieces of a web document. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

```display: block```:  most html elements by default are block. This means they "stack" on top of each other or shown as "rows". display: block is a property that insures that a particular element (that may not necessarily be a "block" element by default) adheres to this rule.

```display: inlne```: some elements are in-line by default. These elements tend to position as "columns" vs the block's "row" principle. That means they tend to show next to each other rather than "stack" or become "rows" like block elements. It allows other elements to  wrap around them. Example: a picture in the middle of text of a news article.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4 areas of box model are margin, border, padding, content.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

you are using the cross-axis when using the property ```align-items```

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git add --all or filename(s)
git commit -m "commit message goes here"
git push or git push origin "desired branch"
