1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

   Semantic HTML is both semantic and presentational. It provides a clear way to communicate
   your mark up code. For example, using the `<p>` tag is universally known to be
   a paragraph tag which provides a clear understanding as well as presentational aspects of
   your code. People know what they are, and browsers know how to display them. This helps
   keep others coordinated on what is going on in the code as well.

2. Describe some differences between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

   `display: block;` are elements that take up an entire width of the parent element, having its own
   horizontal line and taking up that space. Examples are many text elements like paragraphs, headers, lists, blockquote, pre, divs etc.

   `display: inline;` are elements that only take up the space of the specific content, and doesnt
   force a new line or take over spacing of an entire horizontal space. You can fix these on the same
   row as other elements that are also inline. Examples are images, anchor tags, em tags, and span elements.
