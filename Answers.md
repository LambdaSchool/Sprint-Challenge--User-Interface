1. A semantic HTML element is named specifically to describe the content that is contained within it. For example, the <main> tag is semantic because it is representing the main content of the document. Whereas the <header> tag would represent content that describes the entire page, for instance, a title and a logo.

2. The differences between display: block and display: inline are that block elements take up an entire line of a document and every block element will start on a new line. Whereas multiple inline elements can be used on the same line.

3. The four areas of the box model are:
	- Content

	- Padding
