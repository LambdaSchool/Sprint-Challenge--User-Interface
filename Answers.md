1. So semantic refers to what exactly you mean when you say something, right? (As opposed to syntax, which is __how__ you say something.) So the biggest idea behind semantic HTML is: write HTML in a way that explains what each item is supposed to be. Another way to say it is: write your HTML in a way that describes easily how your page is structured.
The reason we talk about this is that HTML can easily get confusing. You can use tags around your items that are non-descriptive (like <div>). They will work and render, but it gives no clue as to who or what that element is. Instead, using descriptive tags (like <header>, <nav>, <section>, & <article>) any human or machine that reads those tags can easily infer what's going on inside those tags.

2. display: block;
    this display type gives an element an entire row of real estate on the viewport. It is
  positioned relative to other block-level elements, but they will each respect each other's
  limits (unless of course explicitly overridden by the programmer with negative margins
  or the like.) Block-level elements have padding and margin apply to them.
  Block level elements are meant to stand alone.
  display: inline;
    this display type sets the element in line with the rest of the content. They're not
  stand-alone elements; inline elements fit into the flow of the elements before it. For
  this reason properties like height, margin, and padding don't apply to them (or behave
  in unexpected ways.)
  Inline elements are meant to be a part of the content flow and not interrupt.
