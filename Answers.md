1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is a way to markup an HTML file with tags that carry meaning to them. This is useful to make your code more readable/understandable for yourself or any other
developer who might read your file. This is also especially helpful for making sure your code can be read and understood by screen-readers or any other technology a user
with a disability might use. Semantic === meaning.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Display: block will cause an element to take up a whole "block" of space on your webpage. It causes a line break between itself and other elements. Display: inline will cause an element
to remain on the same line as other elements, if there is space. It will not cause a line break between itself and other elements.

Content, Padding, Border, and Margin. These are listed in order from inner to outer areas.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
