1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

It's an idea that an HTML markup should convey the meaning of the content and not just an appearance. This means, not using Divs in every possible case, but sectioning areas in order to provide a deeper context to what you're trying to do.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Inline does not take start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary (usually in the form of texts)
