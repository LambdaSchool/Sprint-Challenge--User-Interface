1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
 
 Semantic HTML or markup is HTML that gives meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
 
Display:block lets you set a width and height on an element. It also lets you set a top and bottom margin and or padding.  Display:inline does not respect the margins or paddings.  

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Margin, Border, Padding and Content
 
4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
 
Cross axis

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

It helps manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Developing software without using version control or Git can be risky because you wouldn't have backups.
