1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
HTML markup that lets the browser know the meaning of content; as opposed to other tags that simply allow for styling.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
display:block; makes that section of code into a block in the box model.  By default it will take up all the available window space hortizontally and doesn't allow other blocks to be displayed next to them.

display:inline; lets that content be displayed on the same line with other content.  Inline content cannot have it's own height defined; it will use the same height as the content it is inline with.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Content, Padding, Border, and Margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
The perpendicular axis (not the main axis)

git commit -m "<message here>"
