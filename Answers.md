1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

    - Semantic HTML is a way of structure your HTML so that it has meaning. This is important for search engines like Google to scan your HTML and get a sense of the structure and the meaning behind the content. So when creating something as simple as a nav bar, instead of placing the a tags in a div, which has little meaning, you place it in a nav bar. A search engine will then have a better understanding of the content in the nav bar and know that the content within it is designated for navigation.

    - Block level elements are elements that take up the entire width of the viewport

    - Examples of inline elements: img, a, and span.
