1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is used to provide meaning to the structure of a webpage to improve both human understanding and browser interpretation. For example, the <nav> tag explicitly refers to a webpages navigation rather than using an ambiguous <div> tag. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Inline are laid out horizontally and allow other elements to sit next to them, while block forces line breaks before and after. Horizontal margins for both behave as expected, but vertical margins for inline will not move the surrounding elements. Block takes the full width of the parent unless specified, where inline takes only the necessary width. Inline dimensions cannot be specified, but block can.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

The four areas of the box model are content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

The property align-items refers to the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

git commit -m 'Commit message here!'
