1. Semantics, as related to language, is concerned with meaning. This is not so different in computer programming. In the context of web developement, semantic html informs both web browsers and future readers of code not only about how an element behaves, but also what content to expect to go along with such an element. This makes gathering information about a website more practical and efficient: e.g. a future editor knows what texts are headlines, titles, etc. while a search engine can discern what is the most important/relevant information on a page (think H1 vs H6). 

2. The most obvious difference between display:block & display:inline is that the latter does not require the same work in order to place elements side by side or on the same line. Functionality is the key difference: the former demands its own space and can make an element "stand out," while display:inline can bring elements together, block displays also create new lines while inlines do not. 

3. The four areas of the box model are (from inner to outer, respectively): content, padding, border, and margin. 

4. The vertical axis is used when using align-items:center during the use of flexbox.

5. The git command to commit stages changes and a message is "commit -m 'Hello world.' " without the "Hello world."
