**1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?**
Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a web page instead of just the layout. It tells search engines, screen readers, etc... what is in the different sections of a page instead of the plain ol' `div`tags.

  

**2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.**
They are used for different things. Using `display: block` will make sure that an inline element ends up taking up the whole width of the container that it is in while a `display: inline`will do the opposite and ensure that a block element takes up the width of the element itself.

  

**3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?**
The 4 areas of the box model are margin, border, padding, and content.

  

**4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?**
We are using the cross-axis when we use `align-items: center`.

  

**5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?**
The command is `git commit -m "Message goes here"`.
