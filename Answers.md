1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML tags are tags with meaning. It helps search engines and SEO determine the important parts of a page. It also gives computers more information about a section, for example if you tag something as <nav>, the computer will know it has important link information versus if you simply put your navigation info in a <ul> list.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

inline elements are displayed only taking up the space needed of their element, but a block element will stretch across the page when displayed. When using display: block you can assign height and width to your elements, essentially making blocks of display on your page. You cannot do that with display: inline.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
