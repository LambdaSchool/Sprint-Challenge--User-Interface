1. I would describe semantic HTML as HTML written to make sense to human readers.
2. display: block creates a rectangular section that respects height and width and takes the full width of the part of the page it appears, but does not respect other html elements next to it, while display: inline can have html elements next to it but cannot have height set.
3. Content, padding, border, margin
4. Cross axis
5. git commit -m
