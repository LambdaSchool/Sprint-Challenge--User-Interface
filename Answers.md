1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is a practice in web standards to provide more clarity in the code that you write. This allows meaning in what you're writing not just in the presentation and the views, but too, for your team and the other coders who will encounter what you've written. Semantic HTML helps greatly in how a search engine will index you in their searches, as it has more readable markup to process. There are some accessability easings with more clearly defined code structure, especially in the capabilities of screenreaders for the visually impared. Overall, semantics matter and will keep your code cohesive and clear for whomever will encounter it next.



2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Inline block does not force a new line after placement, where are block extends to the end of the screen and thus forces a new line. 
Inline elements can then used next to each other (horizontally) where as block cannot. Inline elements are similar to the movement of words that go together on a page. 

Very importantly, block elements accept values for height, width as well as box model properties (margin, padding, etc). If there is no height specified on a block element, it will expand to fit the other elements, so long as they are not positioned or floated.

Inline elements, on the other hand, do not respond to width or height properties.



3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Margin, border, padding, content.



4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```? The cross axis.



5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? git commit -m 'your message'
