1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML has meaning which makes our websites easier to parse by
web crawlers. A section tag is understood by a web crawler to mean that
the content could be placed on another website and still be understood.
Placing that same content within a div is meaningless to web crawlers.
Semantic HTML also helps with search engine optimization and can mean
the difference between being result #1 on Google or result #10.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block elements will fill the space to the left and right of them on the page, inline elements only take up as much width as is needed. Also, block elements always start on a new line and inline elements do not.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Cross-axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m "Insert message here"
