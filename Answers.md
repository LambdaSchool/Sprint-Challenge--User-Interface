1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

When it comes to HTML and the layout for your page, you may want to provide meaning to it. That's where semantic HTML comes in. Rather than using something like 
a <div>, we may want to use something like: <header>,<p>,<footer>, ect. The list goes on. We want to be able to tell the browser whats going on in our HTML so it knows what what to interpret on the page. This makes it easier for the machine to understand it, as well as the reader, consumer and developer.


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Certain elements in HTML are either a block element or an inline element. Block elements take up space on the page in a 'block. They don't allow any other elements next to them, almost like they are 'blocking' the other elements from being on the same line and make the next block element start on the next line. Inline elements let other elements sit next to them on the same line instead of pushing them to the next line.
