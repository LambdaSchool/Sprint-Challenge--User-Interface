1. Semantic HTML lets both the browser and the developer know what the tag is being used for. It's
    basically a clearer explanation of what is being done with the data.

2. inline:	Displays inside of the current block on the same line. Setting height and width have no effect.
            
   block:	Displays block element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width. Has whitespace
            above and below. 

3. From the inside out: Content, padding, border, margin.

4. Cross-axis.

5. git commit -m "message"
