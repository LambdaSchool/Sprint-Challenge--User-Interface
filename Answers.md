1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML adds meaning to a page, often used for screen readers or by Google to define sections, headers, specific sorts of tags like `<nav>`, or other features of the web page. These things cannot be as easily defined through `<div>` tags or other sorts.

2. Describe some differences between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

The `display: block;` css style makes elements take up the entire page. In addition, it also displays elements stacked on top of each other. In contrast, the `display: inline;` style moves elements to nest, by default, in a row from left-to-right.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

The 4 areas of the box model are the content, padding, border, and margin (going from inner-most to outer-most).

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

The axis manipulated by `align-items: center;` in the flexbox module is the cross axis. This axis runs from cross start to cross end, but can vary in direction depending on which property has been defined by `flex-direction`. By default, the cross axis runs from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

The git command to commit staged changes is `git commit -m "insert message here"`. This is obviously also the way that you write messages. If you do not include the `-m "insert message here"` part of the command, git will try to open your preferred text editor to create a more developed commit message.
