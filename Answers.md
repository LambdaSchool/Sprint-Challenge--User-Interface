1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
<<<<<<< HEAD
      Semantic HTML is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation, it has meaning to both the browser and the developer. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
      display: block :takes up the full width available, with a new line before and after; 
                      a line break before and after the element;
      display: inline: takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not force new lines;               
                       no line break before or after the element;
                       
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
      Content, Padding, Border, Margin
      
4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
      Cross axis 
      
5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
      git commit -m "  "
