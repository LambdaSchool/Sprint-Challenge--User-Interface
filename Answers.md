1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a way of tagging your content that makes it more organized, not only for your own coding, but for other developers who need to understand it. For example, whereas you could easily use <div> tags to section off each piece of your webpage (e.g. the navigation, header, main content, secondary content, and footer), using semantic sectioning tags will make reading and working with your code a little more intuitive. In some cases, it may also make your content more accessible and responsive to certain types of apps, devices, and websites (e.g. if you wrap the article on a news site in an <article> tag, an app like Flipboard can isolate the article content to be inserted into their specific display).

Some semantic tags include: <header>, <article>, <section>, and <footer>.



2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

display: block; causes the affected element to take up a block across the full page, and forces a line-break between it and other elements (both top and bottom). 

display: inline; takes up only the space of its content, and sits inline with other elements surrounding it without creating any line breaks. 



3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Working from the innermost to the outermost, the box model areas are content, padding, border, and margin.



4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?

Align-items: center; would center the content along the cross-axis.



5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

git commit -m "This command will commit added files and add this message as a comment"
