1. Semantic HTML is a way to make the anchors and tags of your website more "descriptive" so it's meta-data can be more easily found and comprehended. Instead of just <div> everywhere, semantic tags like <header> <section> <article> <footer> <figure> more accurately describe the "meaning" of your content, not just what goes where. 

2. The main difference is, an element with {display: block} takes up the entire width of the browser - or as much space as possible; and {display: inline} only takes up the space of the content (i.e., text or image) contained in that element. 

3. The four areas of the box model include: Content, Padding, Border, and Margin. 

4. The property {align-items: center} is using the 'row' or horizontal axis {flex-direction: row}. 

5. The git command to commit staged changes is $ git commit -m "message-written-here"
