1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML gives meaning to the content, rather than being purely for presentation or organization. For instance, using <address> rather than <div> when surrounding an address is helpful because it indicates to both the browser and future developers what the contained content is, at a glance. Using only one <h1> on the page makes it possible to rank the importance of certain information, which provides meaning, rather than it being purely for styling and presentation.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Block will take up as much space as it can, pushing other objects to the next line, if necessary. Inline is "polite" and uses just enough space to surround the contained content. Block can be used in conjunction with sizing properties like width and height, while inline can't.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
From inner to outer: Content, padding, border, margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```? 
Cross Axis

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
git commit -m "This is my message"
