1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is a way to avoid the hassles of 'DIV soup'. Instead of using DIV's to markup all of your HTML, we can use Semantic HTML to convey the underlying meaning of your content. Instead of everything being a DIVs, your webpage can be seperated by sections such as headers, articles, and footers. Another advantage to this is that search engines, other machines, and other people have an easier time identifying different parts to your website this way.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

Block elements take of their own line, and the width of a page. Inline elements appear on the same line as where you used them and can even appear within a block element.

Cross-axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
