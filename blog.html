        <h1>Learn How To Code HTML… and Have Fun!</h1>
        <p>
          When you’re managing a blog or a website, knowing the basics of HTML,
          CSS or even Javascript can be a crucial skill to have. Even if you
          don’t plan on building your own site from the ground up, common things
          like creating linked images, or creating stylized text, are important
          to know. In the HTML/CSS lessons on this website, I’ve always
          encouraged you to physically type out the codes and learn them as
          opposed to copying and pasting them. Understanding what does what and
          why things should be done certain ways has more power than the click
          of a Paste button. The guys over at Code Avengers recently contacted
          me and shared their awesome website. It promises to teach you how to
          code websites, apps, and games in a fun and easy manner. Curious, I
          started their HTML lesson for free to see what it was all about. Let
          me just say this… They nailed it. The way the site is set up and the
          way they teach is genius, so there was no way I could not share this
          with you.

          When you begin, you’ll learn about the different areas of your screen
          and how the site works. Your tasks appear in the left hand section,
          the center is where you will code, and the right shows a live preview
          of your work. The tasks walk you through the lessons one step at a
          time and allow you to see your progress on the live preview. You earn
          points for each task you successfully complete, so the idea that this
          is more of a challenge or a game actually makes it fun to learn!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you get stuck or need some help, there are hint/help icons that you
          can press, however, pressing these decreases the number of points
          you’d collect had you not used them. You can’t proceed to the next
          step until you master your current task, which I think is a great way
          to encourage students to learn instead of just skipping past the ones
          that appear difficult. Aside from learning how to do things correctly,
          you’ll also learn how to fix errors and check your code for mistakes.
          They really did think of everything! After I had my fun with the HTML
          portion, I headed on over to their Javascript lessons to give that at
          try. Personally I do want to brush up on Javascript, but being that
          it’s more math intensive it has gone right over my head! I found the
          first few lessons I completed very easy to understand and am
          definitely going to be sticking with it. I encourage anybody who is
          interested in learning how to improve their coding skills to check out
          Code Avengers and give the free lessons a try. If anything, you’ll
          learn how to do some basic functions in a way that is easy to
          understand!
