1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is essentially a fundamental part of basic building blocks of the web. If you were to compare a 
webpage to a body, then the HTML would be the bone structure. Within this base HTML is all the standard content you will put on the webpages (posts, about sections, photos, links, etc.) and around that you make the webpage styled and
interactive.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

`display: block` will show us the content as if it takes up a "block" of the page. This means it will always
start on a new line and take up the whole width.

`display: inline` will display that content "inline" with the rest of the content on that same line (height and width
have no effect)
