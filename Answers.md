1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML describes html elements that provide a specific meaning to your code.  The <p> or paragraph element is a semantic html element, it is telling your code that what is inside is a paragraph and will be seperated into just that.  Another example of a semantic html element would be the <footer> element.  This element wraps around the information you wish to store at the bottom of your page as a footer, almost like in a word document. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Display: block; will start on its own line and expand to the width of the page. It includes elements such as div, section, and p.  These elements all make up the main information on a page and are seen by users.

Display: inline; will only take up as much space as needed, and fits inside of the block elememts.  Elements such as span, button, and img, are inline elements and are only seen or used for display purposes.
