1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is way of writing HTML that makes the code more self documenting. The tags are 'sematically' named to easily understand what each code section is doing. For example, the header section is wrapped in a `<header>` tag and navigation is wrapped in a `<nav>` tag...

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block displays HTML in the document flow using up the entire horizontal space for each element.
Display inline displays within the text ignoring height and width. A `<span>` tag is an example of an `display: inline` element.
