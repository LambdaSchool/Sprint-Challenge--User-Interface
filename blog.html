      <h4>About Time</h4>
    <p>
      Education technology - Edtech - is one of the UK's fastest growing sectors. It accounts for four percent of all digital companies, according to The Education Foundation.

      Recent figures show the UK is first in Europe for venture capital and angel investing, accounting for 34 percent of total investment in the sector.
      
      This is partly due to the increasing demand for tech in the classroom, with schools across the UK spending close to £900 million on edtech each year to leverage learning, according to the Guardian.
      
      As a result, 1,200 edtech companies - a quarter of Europe's total - are based in the UK, and the sector is growing 22 percent year on year, says bi-monthly magazine Education Technology.
      
      Here are some of the most innovative UK edtech startups.

    <h4>Pricing</h4>
  <p>Compare prices. You can sort results by 'base price' (without postage) or 'total price' (including postage) – helping you decide whether to buy in store or online. We compared Google Shopping with a number of similar sites, and although it usually found the cheapest price, it can still be worth checking another comparison site, such as Kelkoo , Pricerunner or Price Spy , before you buy.</p>
