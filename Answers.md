1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I would describe to the next cohort of students that semantic HTML gives your content meaning. I would encourage them to not think of it as the way their content looks, but instead think about that it organizes the content in order for it to be easier found on search engines. Other than making your code more organized, another big bonus about using semantic HTML is that it is able to be read by screen readers. It is important to create content that is able to be used by everyone.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block starts on a new line of code and it's element tags are <div> and <p>. They go left to right and you can add things like margins and padding around them. Whereas Inline don't start a new line and almost act like text in the code. Inline element tags are <img> and <span> etc. 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
