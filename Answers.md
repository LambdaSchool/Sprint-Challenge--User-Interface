1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

   Semantic HTML is a way to ensure that browsers and search engines understand your HTML code. For example, information within a header <h1> tag will be read by search engines as descriptors of your webpage. Other visual or aesthetic tags don't have this functionality.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

   The 4 areas of the box model are content, padding, border, and margin. The content within the box is placed at the center. Around that is the padding, which is space between the content and the border. Padding often makes text content look nicer or easier to read. Around the padding is the border, which can be made as a solid color or in various other designs. Around the border is the margin, which is blank space that separates this box from others.
