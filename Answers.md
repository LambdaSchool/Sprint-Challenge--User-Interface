Question 1: If I had to describe semantic HTML, I would explain it as the skeleton of this living body known as web development. Semantic serves as the most basic structure in which we build our content around and begin to see how we want it to look like.

Question 2: There are a few key differences between display: block and display: inline. The key differences being how they react next to the HTML content around them. Display: inline does not cause line breaks. Its space is bounded by its closing tag, making it ideal to use within other HTML elements. Display: block, however, takes up the full space from left to right. It can take up multiple lines and generally has a line break before and after it.

Question 3: The four areas of the box model are content, padding, border, and margin.

Question 4: For align-items: center; you are working across the flexbox's cross-axis.

Question 5: The git command to commit staged changes and make messages simultaneously is "git commit -m"
