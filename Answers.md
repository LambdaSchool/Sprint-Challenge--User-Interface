User Interface - Sprint Challenge

Comprehension Questions:

1. A website is made up of two parts: structure and styling. The structure of the website is determined using HTML and the styling is added using CSS. When creating the structure of the HTML, it is important that the content has the correct meaning assigned by using semantic HTML. Semantic HTML is a best practice for ensuring that the HTML content and structure of a website is informative. The HTML tags used to structure a website should hint at the meaning of each element. It's important to provide accurate meaning to HTML with semantic HTML so that search engines and other web crawlers can deduct the key parts of a website.

2. All HTML elements contain a display property that is used to determine how the element is rendered by the browser. The two key property values are block and inline. The main differences between display:block and display:inline are that inline elements exist within the same line as the elements that surround it while block elements always start a new line. 
Inline elements do not begin a new line. An example of an inline element is the <img> tag. Additionally, inline elements only take up as much width as required from its content. 
On the other hand, a block element always begins in a new line and takes up the full width available. An example of a block element is a <p> tag.
