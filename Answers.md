1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML are meaningful elements that are descriptive to both people and computers. Unlike divs, you wouldn't use it for purely aesthetic reasons -- since it's descriptive, it gives your code some organization and it makes it easy for things like search engines and other developers to find out how content in a page is divided and relates to one another.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

```display: inline;``` means that the content that has this property would appear on the same line as all other content next to it. It doesn't force itself to take up all available space on a line. On the other hand, ```display: block;``` will start on a new line and take up all available space on that line. It doesn't share.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content (which includes text and images), Padding (which provides a buffer between the content and border), Border, and Margin (which is between the border and the rest of the page).

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

You're using the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m "write message here"
