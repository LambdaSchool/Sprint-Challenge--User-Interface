1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
	Semantic HTML contains significant meaning to the humans and machines that read it. With a page layout containing tags such as aritcles, sections, navs, headers, footers, and more, it makes the code much easier to understand and edit as well as optimizing it for search engines and web crawlers.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
	Display block extends the entire width of the page and begins on a new line. Display inline extends to the content width and height and these values cannot be edited. Additionally, display inline doesn't respect top/bottom margins/paddings and doesn't begin on a new line.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
	The 4 areas are content, padding, border, and margin. Every element respects this model. Box-sizing: border box; includes the padding value(s) within the width and height values. When padding is added, it adds to the inside of the box rather than the outside. Circular elements with border radii also respect the box model behind the scenes.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
	No matter the flex-direction, the axis being used with the align-items property is the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
	The git command is git commit -m followed by a message surrounded with quotes. The git commit --amend command is used to change a previous commit but is acted upon as a new commit.
