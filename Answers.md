1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

An example of this is when you're searching on Google for a company's contact information then having that contact information display prominently at the top of your search results. In the case of the contact information displaying at the top of your search results, it's most likely related to the company's website using semantic tags for that information on their website, which allows Google (and other search engines) to index that information for easier reference.
