1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

  _Semantic HTML conveys the meaning of content and layout being displayed, such as `<p>` for paragraph, `<nav>` for navigation, and `<section>` for section content. This facilitates search engines and screen readers to more accurately identify and classify the content of a website._


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

  _Elements with the `display:block` property will take up the entire width of the parent element by default. Elements with the `display: inline` property only take up as much width as necessary._ 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?


  _The 4 areas of the box model are:_

    1. margin

    2. border

    3. padding

    4. content


4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

  _The flexbox property `align-items: center` works on the cross-axis._


5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

  _Git is a valuable tool for development team because it provides the following features:_

    - Ability to share and work on source code in a distributed manner

      - Each developer can have their own copy of the source code which then can be merged back to the original

    - Ability to save, track, and rollback changes made to the source code

    - Ability for 2 or more developers to work on source code without the risk of overwriting each other's work

    - Ability to easily create different "branches" (i.e. versions) of the source code to development and test new code

    - Ease of backing up and restoring source code and relevant save points.
