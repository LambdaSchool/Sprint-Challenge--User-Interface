1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is used when you want to define the meaning of the content you are creating. This is in contrast to presentational HTML, which is used to define the appearance of the content. One example would be the semantic tag "<section>" telling you there is a section of content, and the presentational tag "<div>" telling you there is just a page division.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;
When an element is displayed as a block, it wants to take up the entire width of its parent element. An inline element only takes up as much width as its content requires. You can also set a width and height to a block element, whereas an inline element will not take either of these properties. Another difference is that a block element will have a line break after it, while an inline element can sit next to another element on the same line.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
They are (from inside to outside): The content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
You are controlling the alignment of the flex items along the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
You would use: "git commit -m <your message here>"
