1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML gives meaning to the webpage rather than just presentational value. For example, a <p> tag is semantic as it will indicate that the text is a paragraph and thus edit the style. A div tag is simply presentational; it gives no meaning to the webpage.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display: block; starts on a new line and takes up the whole width available. The <div> element is a block level element.
Display: inline; does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as is necessary. <span>, <a>, <img> are inline elements.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, padding, border, margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Cross axis - i.e. Y axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m "stuff"
