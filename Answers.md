1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

    HTML is a markup language. It uses ‘semantic’ tags that tell the browser what and where a paragraph is, a link, button, an image, etc. Though not aesthetically pleasing compared to modern web designs, it serves a structural function. Think of it as the foundation or the blueprint of a house. It can later be styled with CSS. 


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

    Display: block creates a new line because it takes up the entire width of the browser.
    Display: inline only takes up the width of the element. It can exist next to other elements OR inside a block.
