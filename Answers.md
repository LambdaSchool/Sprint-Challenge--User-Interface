1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

It sounds like a confusing topic, but its easier to understand in these terms. A long time ago people would make any type of html tag they wanted such as <Marshall>. However this became comfusing for developers and search engines. To make things easier an organization called the W3C came up with recommended standards for developers to go by to describe what is going on in the page. Examples would include h1, p, section, header, or footer. It is also imporant to know that this information is used by search engines to day to find and organize what is important on your webpage. For example h1 would come up as your most important heading while h2 second most then h3. Following these standards also makes it easier for other developers to see and understand what you have on your page. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block takes up the entire length of the line its on and has a line brake. Display inline takes up only the length of the content and has no line brake. This is why display inline-block can be popular because it has no line brake, but you can add styling that goes beyond the content section such as width, height and also the margins/paddings are respected
