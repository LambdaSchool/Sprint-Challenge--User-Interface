1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is used for people, but mainly computers, to be able to interpret what different parts of your website are (to get meaning) and how they should be indexed or displayed in things like a search engine.

A quick example would be the header and footer of a webpage. You could have identical looking pages but if one used styles the header and footer with <div> tags  and the other used the semantic HTML tags <header> and <footer> for each, then the website that used the HTML tags would have an advantage in a search engine for example that was looking for <header> tags to display prominently. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

```display: inline;``` keeps everything on the same line. You can put elements next to each other. These only takeup the width that they need. A <button> or a <img> are examples of inline elements. 

```display: block;``` These elements start on a new line everytime and takeup the full width available. A <div> is an example of a block element. 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Let's start with a content box in the middle. This box is surrounded by space between itself and the border. This space is called the padding. The space between the border and the next box or element is the margin. 

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

The cross-axis. 

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m "message"
