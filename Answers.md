1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
  * Semantic HTML is a whole new way of structuring your web page. When we say semantic, it adds meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. Using semantic when writing your HTML code, it makes it easier for search engines like Google to identify different parts of your website. It will know which part of your website is important with the help of the heading tags, `<h1>` as the most important. And it will also help you to organize and maintain your code.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
  * The difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline` is that `display: block` will force an element to take up the entire line or width of the page and have a line break before and after them. On the other hand, `display: inline` does not cause a line break  and does not take up the full width of a page like the `display: block`. It only takes up the space bounded by its opening and closing tag.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
  * The 4 areas of the box model are: margin, border, padding and content.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
  * The cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
  * `git commit -m "Your message here"`
