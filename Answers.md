1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is HTML that can be easily read and maintained. It replaces the need for divs, for example you would be able to identify the header with the <header> tag.
 
2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Display block is the main display style for most html elements. It is great when you want one section/tag to be the full width of the page. It also allows you to set the width and height. Inline on the other hand is everything else. These elements, like span, allow you to put elements in the normal flow of the page. You can set width but not height.
