### 1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
   ##### Semantic HTML is HTML that uses tag names that are more specific about what is contained within them. For example, when using a <div> tag, there is no way of knowing what is contained in that tag based on the tag itself. Whereas using a semantic tag, such as ```<nav>```, ```<header>```, ```<section>```, or ```<footer>```, gives a little bit more information about what is contained inside of the tag.

### 2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
  #####  An element with display: block; will take up the entire width of its container. An element that has display: inline; will only take up as much horizontal space as it's content needs. This allows other elements to be on the same line.
