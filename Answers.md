1. Semantic HTML is markup that conveys meaning about the structural elements of your webpage. For example, instead of wrapping your navigation bar in <div> tags, wrap it in <nav> tags. This makes your markup more easily understood by other developers that may look at your code or to you when you go back to edit your code.

2. - Elements with display: block; take up the full width available to them. Elements with display: inline; take up only as much width as their content needs.
   - Block elements start a new line. Inline do not start a new line. 
   - Block level elements can have margin on all sides. Inline can only have margin on the left and right.

3. margin, border, padding, content

4. cross-axis

5. Git commit -m “Your message goes here”
