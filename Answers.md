2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    `display: block;` renders an element as a block element that takes up the space of the entire new line, while `display: inline;` renders an element as an inline element that doesn't take a new line and doesn't disrupt the flow of content (LS training kit).

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
