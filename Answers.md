1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Brandi -->  Semantic HTML is a way of marking up your HTML in order to provide meaning to browsers for rendering/interpretation.  In semantic HTML, elements are marked up with meaning dictionary terms that explain what the element is.  For example:  tagging a section with <section></section> allows the browser to realize the enclosed is a section of the page, rather than just a generic div.  The same can be done with <footer></footer> to denote the footer of the page, and <nav></nav> encompasses the navigation section of the webpage.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Brandi -->  display: block; and display: inline; properties differ in that display: block elements take the entire width of the parent container, which display: inline; elements allow multiple elements to reside on the same line and only take up the necessary space to allow both (or assigned multiple) elements within the width of the parent div.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Brandi --> The four areas of the box model are:  content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
Brandi -->  When using align-items: center; you're aligning items along the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
Brandi -->  The command to commit staged changes and writing a message are as follows:
  git commit -m"Insert meaningful text related to commit here"
