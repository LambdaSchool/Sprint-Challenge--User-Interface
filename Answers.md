1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

A value of "inline" signifies that the element doesn't break the flow of content on a page, such as when links (a elements) are included in text.
