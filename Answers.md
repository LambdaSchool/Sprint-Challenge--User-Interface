1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML elements are elements that give meaning to both the developer and the browser - examples of semantic HTML elements are section, header, nav, and p. The other type of element is a presentational element. Div would be a presentational element, as it has no meaning to the browser or the developer. It is simply used to order and group things to make them look better.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

When using ```display: block```, the element will technically stretch to the end of its container. On the contrary, ```display: inline``` will allow the element to display next to, or in line with, other elements in the same container.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

The box model has margins, borders, padding, and content area.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

```align-items``` makes use of the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

```git commit -m 'message'``` will commit your changes and add a message.
