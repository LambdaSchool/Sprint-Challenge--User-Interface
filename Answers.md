1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

	Semantic HTML involves using HTML tags that convey the meaning of their content through the tag name itself. Such as a nav tag
	conveys the message that it's contents are navigation items, just by reading the tag. An example of non-semantic, or presentational
	HTML would be like a div tag.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

	Display Block will take up the entire width of its container by default, however it's size can be hard-coded into the site or application
	Display inline has a size that is completely based on its content, allowing inline items to display next to each other. You can not set
	its width or height though.
