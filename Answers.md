1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say? I wold say that semantic HTML is a way to add meaning to our tags and that its purpose is to allow us, as developers, to write more meaningful tags to describe our code. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```. The primary difference is that "display: inline" can easily be nested within a line of code without breaking the flow of the content. "display:block", however, takes up as much space as the parent element will allow. Therefore, if it is used we must also apply some "width and height." Otherwise, block elements will break the flow of the content. 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model? content, margin, padding, borders.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```? The main axis. 

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? "git commmit -m"
