If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML consists of the tags you add to section off your content which signify the meaning of a section as a user, screen reader or search engine might interpret it. Semantic tags tell users where the header is, where the main content is, what content is actually an aside, where the contact info is etc. They aid accessibility and search engine optimization.
