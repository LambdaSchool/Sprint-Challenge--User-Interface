1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML is one of two approaches to writing HTML, with the other being presentational HTML. The defining characteristic and purpose of semantic HTML is to convey meaning through the use of thoughtful tags. We use semantic HTML to avoid the incoherence of div soup; semantic markdown is more optimal for anyone reading our code, as well as for accessibility and SEO.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    Elements with ```display: block;``` will traverse the entire width of their parent element by default so they won't arrange themselves in a row of side-by-side items. However, the width and height of these elements can be changed. Alternately, elements with ```display: inline;``` can be arranged side-by-side in a row of multiple elements, but they do not support height specifications.
