If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML helps to keep content meaningful by adding tags that can tell a user what that content is or its purpose on the page. 
Its also useful for screen-readers for those with disabilities.

Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

Display:inline; only takes up the space of its content, height and width do not affect it, and vertical align and text-align
can be used for vertical and horizontal alignment, respectively. It cannot be nested into a block element.

Display:block; takes up the space of its parent element, has height and width controls, elements start a new line, and can be
nested in inline or block elements.
