1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
The best / easiest way to describe semantic HTML is "Meaningful HTML" the difference is that the search engine has a much easier time recognizing the content on the page, you could either use divs for everything or seperate it into meaningful html which could include <header> <nav> <section> etc.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Display block takes up the full width of the page and orders the content in an almost cascading manner (with one on top of the other) where as inline block takes in the box model and than organizes the page depending on if the content fits

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Height/width (content), Padding, Border, and Margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
Cross axis

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
git commit -m "message here"
