1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

1. Semantics is a word that means “meaning”. Semantic HTML therefore is creating code that has meaning, i.e. you can figure out what you were trying to do when you revisit the code long after you’ve forgotten what you were trying to do.
2. I think of inline as blending in with what is around it, and block as standing off from what’s around it, absent other formatting. Once we got to flexbox, I started thinking of inline as somewhat equivalent to the main axis and block as somewhat like the cross axis. I don’t know if that analogy will hold up once I know more, but as of today that’s what’s rattling around my head.
3. Margin, Border, Padding and Content
4. The cross axis
5. git commit –m “Commit message goes here”
