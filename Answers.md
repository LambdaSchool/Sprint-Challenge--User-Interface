2. display: block; if no width, expands to parent size. display: inline; ignores width altogether
   display: block; ignores vertical align, where display: inline; does not
   display: inline; will not clear to drop lines like block does 
3. margin, border, padding, content
4. cross axis 
5. git commit -m 'message'
