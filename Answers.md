1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say? Semantic HTML is a method of giving the underlying HTML tags meaning.  It does not affect the presentation so much as it affects the meaning of the content of the web page.  This in turn affects search engine optimization because searach engines are better able to use semantic tags to assign better meaning to a web page's content.  A great example is the <div> tag.  This tag is very useful in presentational HTML but really does not convey any underlying meaning, whereas a tag like <section>, <header>, or <footer> (all three of which are semantic tags) convey much more meaning.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.  - Display: block displays each item always on a new line because each item always uses up the maximum width available.  Display: inline displays horizontally, or next to each other because each item only uses up enough width for the item.  Generally display: block displays vertically and display: inline displays horizontally.
