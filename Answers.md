# Task 2: Comprehensive Questions
## 1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I'd start off with an essentially unreadable jumble of text (that has the potential to be organized). I'd ask them: "Why is this difficult to understand?" After working through an answer or two, I would ask what they would do to organize the text (no tags, just spacing and such). We'd get the text spaced out until it was easier to understand. Then I'd show a version of the text *with* tags marking up the text. I'd explain that HTML is just a way of organizing information into something useful. In the same way that the jumble of text didn't really have any useful meaning to us, without HTML the content of a webpage has no meaning to viewers, or to browsers. I'd conclude by explaining that semantic HTML is just about organizing your information to give it the most usable meaning possible; I'd also let them know that semantic sounds like a difficult word, but that it just means "usable meaning."

## 2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

First, elements with display: block; occupy the entire width of their parent. They aren't shown with any siblings next to them. You can change their width and you can effectively use the box model to space them. Elements with display: inline, on the other hand, are the complete opposite and will show next to any other inline siblings. Theyt can't be spaced with padding, margin, or width.

## 3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

The 4 areas of the box model are: **margin, border, padding, width.**

## 4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

Flex containers with the property: `align-items: center` are aligning their flex items along the cross-axis.

## 5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

The git command to commit staged changes, as well as write a message is: `git commit -m "*message here*"`
