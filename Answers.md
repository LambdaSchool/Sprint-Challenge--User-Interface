1. HTML or Hyper text Markup Language is the building blocks of a web page. It stores pretty much all the links and text you see on any web bag. On its own it is pretty boring though and needs styling. It like house that is all framed out and has wall but with out any painting or decoration or anything.

2. Inline: displays an element that only takes up the space the element does. they allow other elements to be on the same line as them.
    Block: displays an element on a new line taking up the entire width of a page. They block out other elements.
