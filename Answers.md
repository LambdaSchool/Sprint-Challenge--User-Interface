1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say? 
Sementic tags supply meaning. In other words, they are used to make it easier for people, computer programs (search enginges, crawlers) and screen readers to understand different types of data. The semantic tags also differentiates the important information on the webpage and enhances the clarity.

If semantic HTML is not used then a webpage jsut becomes a bunch of divs making it harder for screen readers, developers, and computer programs like search engines to see clearly what is important and what is not. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
when you use display: block; it will start a new line and expand the whole width both right and left. such as as an image that you might want to cover the whole width of a webpage.

Whereas, when you use display: inline; the element will not start a new line and interrupt the element it is placed in. A great example of this would be using a span element to highlight text inside a paragraph element.
