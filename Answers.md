1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML gives our tags meaning. This is important to Search Engine Optimization and Screen Reader. These technologies depend on standardized and meaningful tags. Semantic HTML is also very useful for developers reading each others code, allowing for easier maintenance of code. Semantic HTML works in a lot of cases, but when extra presentational markup is needed, divs are still used.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block uses 100% of the space allowed by the container it is in, where as inline only uses the space of its content. Block's normal flow is a new line for everyblock, and inline stays "in line" and wraps when the container is full. Block elements can nest any elements inside of them, but inline can not. Centering with block needs margin: auto, and inline uses text-align: center.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

git commit -m "<message>"
