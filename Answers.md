1) Semantic HTML is using HTML tags in a meaningful way. The meaning helps other people understand the website, and it helps the browser understand the website. For example, an h1 tag's purpose is not to style text by making it bold and big, its main purpose is to tell others and the browser the level of importance of that text. 
2) display: block takes on the whole width of the line because it adds a line-break. It is not meant to be nested in other elements. display: inline is meant to be nested in other elements, but you cannot manipulate the width and height of it. 
3) Content -> Padding -> Border -> Margin
4) The cross axis
5) git commit -m"<message>"
