1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
<p>  Semantic HTML tells webcrawlers/search engines what type of content is in your page and how it should be treated through the use of semantic (meaning making) tags. Examples of tags include address, and time. Through good use of semantic tags, you ensure your website is optimized for indexing in search engines, which leads to more and happier traffic. The traffic is happier because they are more likely to arrive at what they were looking for. </p>

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
 <p> display: block is a property that can be applied to a group of elements, and essentially instructs them to display in a block format. When something is displaying in block format, it stretches across the page, horizontally and nothing else can sit next to it. </p>
 <p> display: inline is similar to display block, but it essentially instructs the elements to display side by side, in a line (<--- inline - see what I dicd there?). Just like block, inline display is oriented horizontally along the display.</p>
