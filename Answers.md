1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

    -I would say that semantic HTML is just a way to structure your HTML in such a way that search engines can better understand your content and get the most meaning out of it to display when people search for your website. And you do that using special tags like ```<header>``` or ```<section>``` for example.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

    -Display block will make the element take up the full width of whatever container it is inside so if it's inside just the body it will take up the full width of the page. That means that nothing will be able to stack up next to it. Display inline means that the element will only be as wide as it's content. It will respect other inline or inline-block elements widths so things can stack up next to it without much problem.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

    -The four areas of the box model are the Content section followed by the Padding section followed by the Border section and ending at the Margin section.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

    -That would be the cross-axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

    -git commit -m "Message goes here"
