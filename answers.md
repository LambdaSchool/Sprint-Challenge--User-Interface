1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

As a part of HTML5, semantic tags, e.g., section, article, nav and footer, give meaning to the structure of content which is important to future developers who read our code along with machine readers and search crawlers. This meaning is contrasted with presentation tags, e.g., div, that merely control how content is rendered in a browser. Div tags can and do appear throughout our content without providing meaning to the content architecture.

4. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git provides version control which allows multiple developers to work on the same file without fear of losing data or information. By recording versions of a file or data git is designed to ensure a recent copy is available and can be restored should the newest set of documents, files or data be damaged or become unusable.  Git saves resources by updating on deltas only when changes are made rather than creating a fully new file or group of files after minor changes or updates.
