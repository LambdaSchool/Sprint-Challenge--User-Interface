1.) Semantic HTML differs from traditional HTML in that Semantic mark ups do more than just dictate the look of the page, they convey meaning.
    Using the <section> tag rather than a <div>, a page creator can communicate that this section contains content to be viewed while a <div> tag
    simply acts as a container, with no information on what it contains. similarly, a tag like <b> doesn't do much except change the font weight
    to bold. However, by using <strong> not only is the style changed but the page creator is able to place emphasis through the elements.
    "This is an important, strong statement. Pay attention". Using semantic HTML will organize your webpage in a more meaningful way which will lead
     to greater hits from a search engine leading to higher visits.

2.) Display Block vs Display Inline: when an HTML tag is used it creates a block on the page that contains the content between the tags.
    when a tag is display block, the block extends across the whole line to the end of the page. All content added after that tag will be
    placed on a new line below the block. When a tag is inline, the created block extends only as far as needed to contain what is between the open and close tag.
    This also means that an inline element will respect specified margin and padding allowing it to be displayed around other elements in the line. This is not possible
    with block elements.
