1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML code with meaning. This meaning should be understood by both human developers and computers.
Semantic HTML is important because it helps other developers understand your code. It'll help other developers understand that the code they are looking at right now is a navigation panel, for example, in the case of a nav tag. This is clearer than just slapping this code in a div tag because a div doesn't have meaning. A div tag wouldn't be immediately clear that it's a navigation panel.
Semantic HTML is also important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Search engines are designed to look for certain tags, structured in certain ways. In order to ensure your page is shown in search results when it should be shown, semantic HTML will help to ensure that.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
display: block results in an element in HTML to exhibit block qualities. It is going to take up the entire horizontal space in the container. It will also be able to take in both height and width properties that you can define. Since it takes up the entire horizontal space, another element cannot be placed to the side of it.

display: inline results in an element in HTML to exhibit inline qualities. The element will not take up the entire horizontal space in the container, like a block element. Instead, it just takes up the space of the content. Also, inline elements are often nested inside other elements since this doesn't disrupt the flow of the website, unlike block elements.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
