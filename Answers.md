1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

<!-- Semantic HTML provides structure and meaning to a web page but the main focus is not on appearance or style. I like to think of it as the skeleton of a web page. -->

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

<!-- Using display: block will create a box that starts on its own line below any previous content.

    Using display: inline will create a box that flows with and essentially acts like text. You can create a box that is within a line of text. 
-->

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

<!-- Margin, Border, Padding, Content -->

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

<!-- align-items: center center the items accross the cross-axis -->

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

<!-- git commit -m "This is a message" -->
