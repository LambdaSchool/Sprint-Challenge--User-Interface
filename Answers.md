1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I would describe semantic HTML as code that has meaning. Someone could look at your code
and understand what everything is without any follow-up. This code specifies what everything is and how it is used.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

The main difference between display:block and display:inline is that display:block takes up as much room as it is allowed and display:inline only takes up as much space as it needs. The good thing about display block though, is that you can adjust the size. Then again you can always get the best of both worlds by using display:inline-block.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

You are using the secondary axis when using the align-items property. If we are assuming the axis are set at default this would mean you are using the Y axis. Therefore your text would still be aligned left, but it would be bumped down to the center of the box.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
