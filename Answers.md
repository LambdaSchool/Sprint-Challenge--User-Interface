1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is the process of using "Semantic Elements" such as headers, <section>, <article>, et al., to logically associate items on your pages into tiers, which are on different levels depending on their importance. Different tags imply different meaning, for example, <article> indicates that the section is a news clip, along with any media response to the clip. <section> implies that the particular section is grouped for importance-tiering purposes. Some elements, such as <div>, do not contribute to html semantically. Using proper Semantic HTML improves the processability of your webpage by automated page-reading applications. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Display block creates a new line for the element, and element will take up the entire width of the line it is on. Display inline elements will begin on the same line that they are used on, and will expand the height of the line to fit their size. Inline elements cannot be modified with CSS attribute "height".
