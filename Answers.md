1. If I had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort I'd say: Semantic HTML is what provides clear meaning to your code rather than just what the code will make the website look like. It communicates to the user what each element is doing and also makes it clear to the browser what certain elements are doing as well.
2. Some differences between block and inline are: block, can be given a height and width. Inline, on the other hand cannot take in a height, but a key difference is inline elements can break on lines. For example if you're writing a sentence in your code and on the website the text goes as far as it can, the line will break to the next one.
3. The four areas are: content, padding, border, and margin.
4. The align-items property uses the cross-axis
