1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML is the practice of using element name tags that describe the purpose of the element as opposed to using generalized element tags that create general elements. The reason for this practice is to make code easier to understand not just for the creator but for any other potential developers.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    Display: block will make the element be the only one displayed on that line and it will not allow any other element to be displayed next to it. The following and preceding elements will be above and below it. Display: inline will make the element align directly to the right of the previous element in the same line and in the same block. This allows for multiple elements to appear as a horizontal list.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
    Content, Padding, Border, and Margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
    This will affect the cross axis, which is perpendicular to the main axis. 

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 
    git commit -m"sample message"
