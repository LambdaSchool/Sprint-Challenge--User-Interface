1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say? <br>
   Semantic HTML is meant to convey meaning to search engines (and potentially humans looking at the source code). Using semantic HTML will improve your SEO. This means using tags like section, nav, header, footer, etc. in place of divs.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```. <br>
   A block's width will stretch to fill the parent container whereas inline will take up only the width it needs for the content. Blocks begin on new lines, but inline elements can start within a given line. Block respects height and width, whereas inline does not respect height.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model? <br>
   Content, Padding, Border, Margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```? <br>
   The cross axis (vertical as default unless flex-direction changes).

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? <br>
   git commit -m "insert msg here"
