1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    I would start by defining the word semantic to them. Semantics has to do with cosidering the 
    meaning of words. This means that when we say semantic HTML, we mean that when we code in HTML 
    we must consider the meanings of the tag elements when we use them. For example, if we have a navigation bar, we wouls wrap the content in <nav> tags. If we are working on the header of the page, we should wrap the content in <header> tags. The importance of this is not only to help us understand our code better when we look at it and edit it but also to help the browser and search engines search for our page when people look it up. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
    ```display: block;``` - takes up all the horizontal space on a page 
    ```display: inline;``` - doesn't take up all the horizontal space and can therefore be 
                             displayed side by side with other display: inline; elements
