If I were to describe semantic HTML, I would say that semantic HTML is a way of creating div's that have meaning. For example, a <p> is a stands for paragraph. It also allows code to be more readable by users and allows for better SEO.

The differences between display:block and inline is that display block takes up one whole line and inline block only encases the content thats inside it.

The for parts of the box model are. Content, Padding, Border, and Margin;

When you use align-items in flexbox you are using the vertical axis.

the git command to write and message and stage changes is git commit -m "Your message here"
