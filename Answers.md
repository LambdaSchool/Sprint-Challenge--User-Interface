1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is HTML that has meaning. They are HTML tags that have more specifity than other tags, such as the header tag, section tag, and footer tag. Non semantic HTML would be like the div tag and p tag.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
"display: block;" will turn the element into a block level element, which means that HTML element will take up the entire space of that container, from left to right on the page. 
"display: inline;" will not take up the entire space from left to right on the page. The name inline is just like how it sounds. It will only effect the tag that it is assigned to and it will keep it "in line" instead of turning it into a block element that occupies the whole container left to right. (it is a smaller container that stays inline with the other content).
