1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

I would say that semantec HTML provides meaning that is helpful for search engines and other applications that read HTML source code than merely-presentational HTML; that the tags provide an actual description of what the enclosed element is for.

Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

Display: block gives an element the entire width of its page space, whereas display: inline allows elements to share the same horizontal space.  

What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content, padding, border, margin.

While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?

Align-itmed uses the cross-axis--by default the vertical axis, but this can switch to the horizontal axis when the flex-direction is changed from row to column (or column-reverse).

What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?

git commit -m <msg>
