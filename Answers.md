1. The idea of semantic HTML tags are to communicate what is appearing on the page instead of just using markup in order to lay a page out. Instead of using nothing but <div> </div> tags, we can instead use things like <section> </section>, <article> </article>, <header> </header>, <footer> </footer>, <nav> </nav>, etc. If you notice, those tags are actually describing what we are putting onto the page whereas a <div> </div> tag is just there for design purposes.

2. Using "display: block;" means that you want the tag to take up an entire line in a block. Using "display: inline" means that you want the tag to use exactly the amount of space that it needs. You can turn a block tag, such as <p> </p>, into an inline tag by using the "display: inline" property, just like you can turn an inline tag, such as <span> </span>, into a block tag by using the "display: block" property.

3. The box model, in order from the furthest inside the box to the furthest outside, consists of the content, the padding, the border, and the margin.

4. The "align-items: center;" property is controlling items along the cross axis.

5. The command to commit a file using git with a message is: git commit -m "Message goes here"
