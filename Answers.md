1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML provides meaning to the content of a web page. It allows both machines and humans to look at the HTML and see more of the meaningful organization of the content - this group of HTML tags is a header; this one is a navigation bar; this one is a section or this one is an aside. Semantic HTML is particularly useful for search engine optimization as it can help provide the search engine with a better understanding of what to display for results.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

display-block: it goes across full screen, it respects both width and height, and it doesn't like to play nice with other elements.
display-inline: it can be inside other elements. It doesn't respect height, but it does respect the content's width.

so a block-level element automatically involves both width and height, while an inline element only has width. inline elements can be inside of other elements, while block level elements don't like playing well inside of other elements.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Content - the thing inside the box.
Padding - the space between the content and the border.
Border- the edge of the box.
Margin - the space around the edge of the box.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message?
