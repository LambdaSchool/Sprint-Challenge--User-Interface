1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is using the proper HTML tags for the necessary sections being built, as opposed to just using "div"s on everything. For example, using the H1(only one) that should be a descriptor of the site, using headers, sections, nav, footers, etc. This also has a major affect for SEO purposes. 

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Block elements take up the full width of the page. They will respect height and width commands. Inline items, however, do not respect height, and also do not take up the full width, but let other elements flow around them if wanted, like an anchor tag or a span.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

The four areas of the box model are the content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Align-items will always be the cross axis.

5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

The git command would be "git commit -m 'this is where your description message would'".
